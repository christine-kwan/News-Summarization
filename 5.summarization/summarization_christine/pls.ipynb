       "      <td>LONDON :Seven-time winners AC Milan reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years as a disciplined display earned them a drab 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and a 1-0 aggregate victory.\\n\\nOn a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.\\n\\nTottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.\\n\\nMilan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.\\n\\nWhile Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.\\n\\nMilan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.\\n\\n\"We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,\" Pioli said. \"We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.\"\\n\\nTHIRD GEAR\\n\\nThe match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.\\n\\nConsidering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.\\n\\nTottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.\\n\\nThe Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.\\n\\nWith the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.\\n\\nAs Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.\\n\\nKane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.\\n\\nConte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.\\n\\nKane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MUNICH: Bayern Munich forward Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting scored against his former club and Serge Gnabry added a late second as the Germans beat Paris St Germain 2-0 on Wednesday (Mar 8) to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.\\n\\nThe 33-year-old Choupo-Moting, who played for PSG from 2018-20, tapped in from a Leon Goretzka assist in the 61st minute.\\n\\nSubstitute Gnabry struck on the break in the 89th minute to seal the hosts' 3-0 aggregate win following their 1-0 victory in the first leg in Paris.\\n\\nThe result established Bayern as one of the title favourites going into the last eight and left PSG's star-studded squad including world champion Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe without a shot at Europe's premier club trophy for another year.\\n\\nThe quarter-final draw will take place on Mar 17.\\n\\nPSG, without injured forward Neymar, were sharper in the early stages and went close through Mbappe and then a double effort from Messi in front of goal in the 25th minute.\\n\\nBayern gradually took the fight to the visitors and had a chance of their own when Musiala's 32nd-minute shot was blocked by keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\\n\\nDespite PSG captain Marquinhos being taken off with a rib injury in the 36th minute, the visitors almost went ahead two minutes later when under pressure Bayern keeper Yann Sommer lost possession in the box.\\n\\nVitinha's shot with the goal at his mercy was cleared on the line by Matthijs de Ligt in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the game.\\n\\nThe Dutch defender had made an almost identical stop against VfB Stuttgart in the league last week.\\n\\nWith Mbappe largely kept quiet, it was his in-form former PSG team mate Choupo-Moting who scored when he struck just past the hour for his 17th goal in all competitions this season.\\n\\nHe had gone close twice a few minutes earlier.\\n\\nPSG attempted to bounce back instantly and had a Sergio Ramos header saved by Sommer two minutes after the goal. The Spaniard also headed wide a little later but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry completed a quick break in the 89th minute.\\n\\n\"The best team won,\" PSG's Danilo said. \"We missed a few chances, it's hard to swallow. They're a very physical side. I don't have words. If we want to improve we have to stick together.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON: Antonio Conte's dismal record in the Champions League continued as his Tottenham Hotspur side exited the competition in the last 16 after a dreary 0-0 draw at home to AC Milan on Wednesday (Mar 8).\\n\\nTottenham never really threatened to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg and went out with a whimper and boos from the home fans whose patience is running out.\\n\\nConte returned to the technical area after missing the last four games following gallbladder surgery but was as subdued as his team on a freezing night in north London.\\n\\nIn six Champions League campaigns with Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Tottenham, the Italian has only managed to reach the Champions League quarter-finals once.\\n\\nAnd with his contract up in June, Wednesday's defeat felt like the beginning of the end of an era even if his side remain in contention to finish in the Premier League top four.\\n\\nWhether or not Conte remains for the rest of the season is not certain, judging by his comments to Italy's Amazon Prime.\\n\\n\"I continue to work, I have a contract with Tottenham. I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Let's see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.\"\\n\\nConte tried to talk about Tottenham's last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.\\n\\n\"We played in the Europa Conference League last year and weren't able to get out of the group stages. Now we took a step forward but it is not enough and if we want to be competitive,\" he said. \"We have to fight.\"\\n\\nTottenham have now failed to score in their last three games, losing in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United, to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and now barely laying a glove on an average Milan side.\\n\\nIn his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go \"step by step\".\\n\\n\"I think the situation is very clear. I always say the same things we need time and patience. We don't have solid foundations to fight and win,\" Conte, who dragged Tottenham into fourth place in the Premier League last season, told reporters.\\n\\n\"We can't make a miracle and I can understand the fans losing patience because for a long time Tottenham have not won anything,\" he said. \"I'm really sorry for the fans but we cannot invent the win. It's important to know this.\\n\\n\"We have to build step by step.\"</td>\n",

       "0  LONDON :Seven-time winners AC Milan reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years as a disciplined display earned them a drab 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and a 1-0 aggregate victory.\\n\\nOn a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.\\n\\nTottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.\\n\\nMilan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.\\n\\nWhile Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.\\n\\nMilan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.\\n\\n\"We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,\" Pioli said. \"We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.\"\\n\\nTHIRD GEAR\\n\\nThe match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.\\n\\nConsidering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.\\n\\nTottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.\\n\\nThe Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.\\n\\nWith the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.\\n\\nAs Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.\\n\\nKane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.\\n\\nConte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.\\n\\nKane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.  \n",

The Spaniard also headed wide a little later but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry completed a quick break in the 89th minute.\\n\\n\"The best team won,\" PSG's Danilo said. \"We missed a few chances, it's hard to swallow.

      "LONDON :Seven-time winners AC Milan reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years as a disciplined display earned them a drab 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and a 1-0 aggregate victory. Milan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through. Milan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle. We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.\" Tottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.\n"

       "content       LONDON :Seven-time winners AC Milan reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years as a disciplined display earned them a drab 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and a 1-0 aggregate victory.\\n\\nOn a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.\\n\\nTottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.\\n\\nMilan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.\\n\\nWhile Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.\\n\\nMilan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.\\n\\n\"We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,\" Pioli said. \"We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.\"\\n\\nTHIRD GEAR\\n\\nThe match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.\\n\\nConsidering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.\\n\\nTottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.\\n\\nThe Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.\\n\\nWith the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.\\n\\nAs Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.\\n\\nKane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.\\n\\nConte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.\\n\\nKane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.\n",
