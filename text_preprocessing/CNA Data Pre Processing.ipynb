Ultimately, my country comes first before individual accolades.\"The Olympic champion added that he would instead focus on his National Service duties and support his team-mates from home.\"I have decided to give my spot to team-mates who have been getting themselves ready and considered for selection while I cheer from home and focus on my Navy duties,\" he said.The 2023 SEA Games will take place from May 5 to May 17 in Cambodia.',\n",
       " 'Lydia Ko and Nelly Korda headline a stellar field at this week\\'s HSBC Women\\'s World Championship, where nine of the world\\'s top 10 golfers will tee off as Singapore\\'s Sentosa Golf Club welcomes spectators for the first time since 2019.New Zealander Ko, who won her season-opener in Saudi Arabia last month to open up a comfortable lead at the top of the world rankings over American Korda, is chasing an elusive first title in Singapore, where a 2015 runner-up finish is her best result.\"You can never get too cocky about what ranked player you are because it\\'s so tight at the top,\" Ko said this week.\"Everyone is playing really well and you can\\'t say, \\'I\\'m going to be there forever\\'.\"When I was younger, I felt like being number one meant that I had to be winning or contending week in, week out, but that\\'s not necessarily true.\"Third-ranked Australian Minjee Lee is among last year\\'s five major champions competing for the US$1.8 million prize purse in the 72-hole, no-cut event, while Ko Jin-young will be looking to defend her lone title of 2022 when play starts on Thursday (Mar 2).The South Korean world number five, a twice major champion, was sidelined for much of last season with a wrist injury and missed back-to-back cuts for the first time in August. She tied for sixth in Thailand last week in her first start of 2023.\"I know there\\'s going to be pressure but I don\\'t want to think too much about it,\" she said. \"I just need to meditate as that has worked well for me in the past and has allowed me to focus more on my swing and golf shots.\"South Koreans have dominated the tournament dubbed \"Asia\\'s major\", winning six of the last seven editions and seven of 14 overall since it was first held in 2008. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Seven-times major winner Park In-bee, the only player to have won the title more than once, will not compete after announcing her pregnancy in December.',\n",
       " 'Novak Djokovic said his return to the top of the world rankings felt like a big achievement after a year of turmoil where he had to skip several tournaments including two Grand Slams, but the Serbian expects a see-sawing battle for the position in 2023.Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.He was forced out of big tournaments in the United States last year, including the US Open, as he was unable to enter the country due to his refusal to take his shots.The 35-year-old also received no points for winning the Wimbledon title due to the grasscourt Grand Slam being penalised for its decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus over Moscow\\'s invasion of Ukraine.\"I think this is the least points I\\'ve had as number one. It happens,\" Djokovic told reporters following his win over Tomas Machac in Dubai on Tuesday (Feb 28).\"It\\'s not only due to my circumstances of not playing a couple of Grand Slams and everything that happened last year, but also other players, some players missing some slams for injuries, some not having the biggest consistency.\"I guess that makes the achievement bigger, at least in my team\\'s and my eyes. I\\'m overwhelmed with pride. I work as hard as anybody else. I\\'m really committed to the sport. And I try.\"Djokovic is now into his 378th week as the world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf\\'s record for the most weeks at the top of the sport.But he said younger players like Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas will eventually catch up with him.\"These guys are playing at a high level constantly. They\\'re playing a lot of tournaments. I\\'m not playing as much and don\\'t plan to play as many weeks as they do,\" Djokovic said.\"Eventually they\\'ll take the number one, then I\\'ll bring it back again, then they\\'ll take it again. We\\'ll go in circles.\"',\n",
       " 'Novak Djokovic won on his return to the ATP Tour following his Australian Open triumph but he had to work hard to beat Czech qualifier Tomas Machac 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(1) in his Dubai Tennis Championships opener on Tuesday (Feb 28).Djokovic, who surpassed Steffi Graf\\'s record for the most weeks as world number one after starting his 378th at the top of the rankings, moved with ease and showed no lingering effects of the hamstring tear he managed at Melbourne Park last month.But there were some signs of rust especially on Djokovic\\'s serve, which seemed to fail him midway through the opening set, before he regained control and took the early advantage in the match when Machac sent a return long.The five-times Dubai champion was in a spot of bother while trailing 3-0 in the next set after dropping serve again and made 16 unforced errors to allow big-hitting Machac to take the contest into a decider.Machac began to struggle with a right wrist issue early in the third set and Djokovic pounced for a 3-1 lead but the Czech mounted a comeback with a break of his own to level at 4-4 with some superb ball-striking along the way.Machac blinked first in the tiebreak and Djokovic did not need another invitation as he finally quelled the world number 130 to extend his 2023 winning streak to 13 matches.\"Tomas didn\\'t play like a world number 130. He played great tennis and deserves all the applause. He was giving me all kinds of trouble but when it mattered most I found another gear,\" Djokovic said.\"Physically I can be better. I demand the highest standards in quality of tennis and preparation. I have struggled with an injury and needed some time. But I\\'m hoping as the tournament progresses that I can raise the level of tennis as well.\"Djokovic next plays Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands.Rotterdam and Doha champion Daniil Medvedev, the third seed, had earlier eased into the next round after dispatching Italian Matteo Arnaldi 6-4, 6-2.Felix Auger-Aliassime had a tougher outing against American Maxime Cressy but the fourth seed prevailed 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-3 while Melbourne semi-finalist Karen Khachanov crashed to Botic van de Zandschulp who sealed a 7-5, 6-2 win.',\n",
       " 'Top seed Carlos Alcaraz has pulled out of this week\\'s ATP 500 event in Acapulco with a strained hamstring, the U.S. Open champion said on Tuesday.The Spanish world number two, who was scheduled to play his opening match later on Tuesday, picked up the injury during his loss to Cameron Norrie in Sunday\\'s Rio Open final where the pain hindered both his movement and serve.\"I have a grade 1 strain in my right hamstring that will keep me out for several days, according to the tests we did this morning,\" Alcaraz wrote on Twitter.\"I\\'m really sad I can\\'t compete here, but now it\\'s time to think about recovering and being ready as soon as possible. I hope to see you all soon!\"After spending more than three months out of action due to abdominal and hamstring injuries, Alcaraz returned to the ATP Tour in February at Buenos Aires where he beat Norrie in the final for his first title since last year\\'s U.S. Open.At the Rio Open, the 19-year-old Spaniard needed treatment for a left leg problem during his semi-final and then picked up an injury to the other leg in the match against Norrie during which he needed his leg wrapped midway through the final.',\n",
       " 'Rafa Nadal said on Tuesday he had decided to withdraw from two upcoming Masters 1000 hardcourt events in Indian Wells and Miami due to injury.The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who has not competed since his Australian Open title defence ended in a second-round loss during which he aggravated a hip problem, said he had started rehab and physiotherapy as instructed by doctors.\"I am sad that I won\\'t be able to compete at Indian Wells nor Miami. Very sad not to be there,\" read a message posted on Nadal\\'s Twitter account. \"I\\'ll miss all my US fans but I hope to see them later this year during the summer swing.\"Nadal lost in straight sets to Taylor Fritz in last year\\'s Indian Wells final and then skipped the Miami Open so that he could focus on his claycourt preparation.The 36-year-old Spaniard is a three-times champion at Indian Wells having triumphed in 2007, 2009 and 2013. Nadal has reached the Miami final five times but has never won the title and has not competed there since 2017.\"We wish Rafa continued healing, and hope to see him back at the BNP Paribas Open next year,\" Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.At the Australian Open, top seed Nadal tweaked his left hip while running for a backhand in the second set at Rod Laver Arena, and after inspection from a trainer when trailing 6-4 5-3, he went off-court for a medical time-out.The 22-times Grand Slam champion returned grim-faced to play out the match but his movement was clearly affected, paving the way for American Mackenzie McDonald to end the Spaniard\\'s bid for a third title at Melbourne Park.',\n",
       " 'BRISTOL, England : Phil Foden\\'s brace eased Manchester City to a 3-0 victory over second-tier Bristol City as they moved into the FA Cup sixth round but Leicester City\\'s hopes of repeating their 2021 triumph were dashed on Tuesday.Foden struck in the seventh minute but it was not an entirely comfortable night for Pep Guardiola\\'s side until the England forward\\'s deflected effort made it 2-0 late on.Kevin De Bruyne then gave the scoreline an emphatic look with a sublime finish from 25 metres although it was harsh on Bristol City who had been on a 12-match unbeaten run and pushed the Premier League champions hard.Leicester were booed off after a 2-1 home defeat by second-tier Blackburn Rovers for whom Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics were on target before a Kelechi Iheanacho reply.Fulham reached the sixth round for the first time in 13 years with superb goals by Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon earning them a 2-0 win over fellow top-flight side Leeds United.Brighton and Hove Albion\\'s hopes of a first ever major trophy remained intact as Evan Ferguson\\'s first-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over second-tier Stoke City.Guardiola named a strong side, as he invariably does in domestic cup competitions, and City began the game in dynamic style with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar.City did not have to wait long to take the lead though with Foden firing high into the roof of the net from Riyad Mahrez\\'s pass across the face of goal.The hosts did not buckle though and had a good shout for a penalty declined when Mark Sykes went down under a challenge from Rico Lewis in the area while Alex Scott forced a decent save from City keeper Stefan Ortega.Bristol City, who were spared having to deal with rested Erling Haaland, were still very much in the game until De Bruyne split their defence with a ball to Nathan Ake whose pass eventually fell to Foden whose shot deflected into the net off of Zak Vyner.\"It was really tough. Bristol showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn\\'t know them. The second half was much better,\" Guardiola said.Promotion-chasing Blackburn thoroughly deserved their win at Leicester whose form remains wildly unpredictable.\"It\\'s just consistency and mentality and ambition to succeed. That\\'s been too up and down for us,\" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.\"I\\'m really disappointed for the supporters. It\\'s been a real challenge for them this season. The FA Cup was an opportunity to get to a quarter-final, against a Championship team at home, but they were a lot better than us, and we have to be worried about that.\"Fulham\\'s magnificent season continues under Marco Silva with the Cottagers still chasing a European qualification spot on two fronts. They were not at their best against Leeds who had a host of chances and a goal disallowed but still showed their quality.Palhinha struck a superb curled effort after winning the ball after 21 minutes and Israeli Solomon\\'s 56th-minute goal was almost as impressive.\"It is great for us to go to the quarter-final,\" Silva, whose side are sixth in the Premier League, said.\"We know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.\"The remaining four fifth-round ties are on Wednesday with League Cup winners Manchester United at home to West Ham United.(This story has been refiled to add the dropped words \\'FA Cup\\' to paragraph 1)',\n",
       " 'Liverpool will play Wolverhampton Wanderers for a fourth time in 11 games and manager Juergen Klopp said they will look to get their Premier League season back on track as they chase a top four spot in a \"super important week\".Liverpool are seventh in the standings, nine points adrift of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place, but Klopp\\'s side have two games in hand, with arch rivals Manchester United visiting Anfield on Sunday.Liverpool played Wolves twice in the FA Cup, winning the replay 1-0 before losing 3-0 in the reverse league fixture earlier this month and Klopp said he hoped to learn from their mistakes in that defeat.\"Nothing I saw in training suggests we don\\'t have a chance. We know a lot about each other and we know it won\\'t be easy. There won\\'t be the most surprising information and we have to make sure we are ready,\" Klopp told reporters.\"It is a super important week, we cannot ignore that. We have two home games ... I would love to give the season a little push in this week and we need results for that. And for results we need good performances.\"The main difference is we will play at Anfield and we have to make that count. It\\'s a long period between games, we want to put it right. But I am more focussed on giving the season a proper push, we need to find a steady mood.\"Liverpool still have several injuries, however, with influential midfielder Thiago Alcantara still sidelined with a hip problem while defender Joe Gomez is also ruled out with a muscle injury.The club did receive a boost with Luis Diaz back in training after a knee injury but Klopp said the Colombian forward has not trained with the team yet.Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez is a doubt with a shoulder injury but Klopp said it was \\'massive\\' to have former Wolves winger Diogo Jota back after the Portugal international returned from a calf injury that had ruled him out of the World Cup.\"Diogo is an exceptional player. He needs to get rhythm now,\" Klopp said.\"He was tired after the game on Saturday (a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace) and we have to see. He will definitely be involved again ... He\\'s a top class player, versatile, helpful for this busy period.\"',\n",
       " 'LONDON: Lewis Hamilton and other Formula One drivers can help steer the sport away from a \\'moral vacuum\\' by speaking out at season-opening races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, human rights campaigners said on Tuesday.Paul Scriven, a member of Britain\\'s House of Lords, told a news conference organised by the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) that the sport was at a fork in the road.\"There are two roads that F1 can now take.

       " \"LONDON: Manchester United's near six-year trophy drought was almost overlooked in the build-up to the League Cup final as Newcastle United's wait for major silverware spanned nearly seven decades.A clinical 2-0 victory at Wembley got the Old Trafford trophy cabinet door swinging open again though and, perhaps more importantly, gave a glimpse of greater things to come under astute Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.The former Ajax Amsterdam boss arrived at Old Trafford with the club in a state of some turmoil on and off the pitch after finishing in sixth place in the Premier League last season.But while there is little he can do about the future ownership of the 20-time English champions, which the American Glazer family have expressed a wish to sell, on the pitch he is shaping a team that looks capable of reviving the glory days.A season that began under a Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped cloud has been transformed since the Portuguese talisman was finally shown the door after a toxic fall-out.Ten Hag has quietly gone about his business, moulding an intelligent team that works tirelessly and is beginning to make winning a habit. A sixth League Cup triumph ended the club's longest wait for a trophy since 1983.And the season could still get better. They are in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Europa League after knocking out Barcelona in midweek and in third place in the Premier League and not out of the title race.Ten Hag experienced some difficult early days. A 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August had some predicting he might be out before the leaves fell off the trees and then there was a humiliating 6-3 defeat at Manchester City.Since that drubbing at The Etihad in early October, United have lost only twice in all competitions, forward Marcus Rashford has turned into a world-beater and the signing of midfielder Casemiro has looked like a stroke of genius.A defence built around the terrier-like Lisandro Martinez and the cultured Raphael Varane snuffed out Newcastle on Sunday, winger Antony is becoming a fan favourite and even old-fashioned centre forward Wout Weghorst, a puzzling signing at the time, looks as though he would run through brick walls for Ten Hag.\",\n",

I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more.\"There was little between the sides in a scrappy first half but the English season\\'s first silverware was effectively decided in the space of six minutes towards halftime.Newcastle were stunned when Brazilian Casemiro met a superb Luke Shaw free kick in the 33rd minute to head past Loris Karius, the goal allowed to stand after a VAR check for offside.Six minutes later Newcastle were left totally deflated when the in-form Marcus Rashford was played in down the left and his shot deflected over a helpless Karius for what initially appeared to be his 17th goal since the World Cup.However, it was credited to the unfortunate Botman.Kicking towards their fans in the second half Newcastle roused themselves into action and pinned a leggy-looking United back at times but they rarely looked like scoring.Newcastle\\'s fans, who had created a sea of black and white with give-away plastic flags at the stadium\\'s west side during the closing minutes, drifted away before the presentation.The Tyneside club has now lost each of their last nine matches at Wembley, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final.Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days.',\n",

Bologna are seventh on 35 points.Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall\\'Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso\\'s volley into his path.Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.They had brief spells of possession in the first half, but created few clear-cut chances as Lautaro Martinez headed an Alessandro Bastoni cross just wide of the target and Henrikh Mkhitaryan twice fired over the bar.Bologna continued to press forward after the break, and Andre Onana kept his side in the game with two crucial saves in quick succession, getting a hand to a Soriano shot before smothering Dominguez\\'s effort from the edge of the area.Romelu Lukaku and substitute Edin Dzeko each had a shot on target, but it was Bologna who broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Orsolini raced on to Jerdy Schouten\\'s pass and powered a shot into the net.\"An incredible match in which many things happened. They cancelled a goal for us, we put Inter down by playing really well and we are satisfied,\" Orsolini told DAZN.\"Schouten put a ball to me, I took advantage of the bounce to bring the ball forward with my chest and in front of Onana I tried to place it under the crossbar.\"In April last year, Bologna recorded a 2-1 home win over Inter, which gave the Nerazzurri\\'s rivals AC Milan the momentum in the title race.',\n",

But once they fell behind a 14th league defeat of the season was almost a formality.They remained third from bottom with 21 points having played a game more than all the teams around them.While Everton are haunted by the looming prospect of a first relegation from the Premier League, Arsenal are beginning to envisage a first title since 2004, although they still have to visit Manchester City in April.\"I am delighted with the win and the way we played after the first 25 minutes.

       " 'The PGA Tour has approved changes for 2024 that will see reduced fields and no cuts at the designated events it created last year in response to the threat posed by the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.The sweeping changes, which were outlined in a letter sent to PGA Tour members by Commissioner Jay Monahan, do not apply to all elevated events as the four majors, The Players Championship and three FedExCup playoff events will be unaffected.\"These smaller, designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can\\'t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of full-field events,\" wrote Monahan.\"Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.\"According to the memo, select designated events in 2024 will feature limited fields of between 70 to 80 players with no cuts taking place after 36 holes and with opportunities for in-form players from full-field events to qualify and compete.By comparison, last month\\'s Phoenix Open, which was the PGA Tour\\'s first fully-fledged designated event, had a field of 136 golfers that was cut to 66 after the second round.Designated events were announced by the PGA Tour last August to get the best players competing against each other more often. The move came amid the threat posed by LIV Golf, which features limited-field, 54-hole events with no cuts and guaranteed prize money for each golfer.\"Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,\" read a message posted on LIV Golf\\'s Twitter account on Wednesday as news of the PGA Tour\\'s designated event changes circulated online.\"FAIR SHAKE\"Starting next year, designated events will include the top 50 players from the previous year\\'s FedExCup regular season list along with the top 10 players not otherwise eligible from the current points list.Other qualification criteria include performance in non-designated events, consideration of the world rankings and sponsor exemptions for some PGA Tour members.World number three Rory McIlroy, speaking to reporters ahead of this week\\'s Arnold Palmer Invitational, said the changes will make the PGA Tour more competitive.\"I\\'m all about rewarding good play. ... I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There\\'s ways to play into it,\" McIlroy, who also holds a position on the PGA Tour\\'s Player Advisory Council, said at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida.\"It\\'s trying to get the top guys versus the hot guys, right? I think that creates a really compelling product. But a way that you don\\'t have to wait an entire year for your good play to then get the opportunity. That opportunity presents itself straight away.\"Max Homa, ranked eighth in the world and also a member of the Player Advisory Council, acknowledged the emergence of LIV Golf, which has lured many big names from the PGA Tour, may have forced the U.S.-based circuit to rethink things.\"One of the things that they have that\\'s great that this will provide now is a guaranteed product. You know who is going to be at each event,\" said Homa.\"I don\\'t think we would be here this soon without LIV, but I would hope at some point we would have looked at this and said, Hey, there might be a better way to do it.\"',\n",

When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his \"big brother\".\"Raymond had character,\" he said. \"So did I, and that made us a magical duo.\"Born in Marrakech in August 1933 to a French father and Spanish mother at the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco, Fontaine went to school in Casablanca, and began his football career there.',\n",

They had the ball but didn’t create many chances. We got the advantage for the second leg and that’s really important,\" Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told TVE.Real Madrid started better and dominated the first 15 minutes, but Barcelona started to turn things around as they took control the midfield and their defensive game plan worked brilliantly.Barca centre back Ronald Araujo did a great job at right back to neutralise the threat of the dangerous Vinicius Jr. and Karim Benzema was left alone up front.Real became frustrated and tempers flared before the hosts made the crucial mistake which gave Barca the winner.Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga gifted a back pass to Ferran Torres who reacted quickly to slide the ball to Franck Kessie.His point-blank strike was saved but bounced off Militao and into the net.The assistant referee signalled offside but the VAR replay showed Kessie was fractionally onside and the goal stood.Barcelona locked Real Madrid into an even tighter situation during the second half and although the hosts dominated possession, they rarely threatened to equalise.Real did not record a single shot on target despite having almost 70 per cent of possession in the second half and Barca should have extended their lead in the 71st minute when a Kessie shot that beat the goalkeeper was blocked by Ansu Fati.Substitute Rodrygo had Real’s best chance with a late long-range strike that flew narrowly wide of the post.The teams meet again in Barcelona on Apr 5 with the winners to face Athletic Bilbao or Osasuna in the final.',\n",

Pistorius has served more than half.A decision is usually known the same day of the parole hearing or a day later, and \"if the decision is negative, the offender has the right to approach the courts for review,\" said Knight.A year before killing Steenkamp, Pistorius became the first double-amputee to race at the Olympics at the London 2012 games.He was initially sentenced to six years in jail but the sentence was later lengthened to 13 after the state appealed that it was unduly lenient.',\n",

The wicket did not get easier, there was variable bounce,” said Bavuma.“But our lead eventually proved to be a lot. The bowlers need to rest, it was a big effort from them. The batters need to get together and work on our game plan. We need to do better next time,” he said after the victory.Kagiso Rabada’s six wicket haul in the second innings ensured victory inside three days for South Africa.“It wasn't the best wicket,” said the South African paceman, “but we made sure to keep up a good intensity and do well.”\",\n",

       " \"MADRID: Barcelona are renegotiating the terms of a €1.5 billion (US$1.59 billion) financial plan with Goldman Sachs to revamp their stadium and may have to repay the debt five years earlier than anticipated, according to a rating agency and a high-level club source.Barcelona approved a 35-year debt plan in a referendum of club members in 2021 that would enable them to renovate their iconic but languishing Camp Nou stadium and its surroundings.The preliminary debt structure has been revised, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) said in reports published on its website, with Barca to make a final repayment in 2047 instead of 2052 as previously agreed..The original plan represented the only source of funding for the Nou Camp project. Under the amended structure, notes would be issued for €1.3 billion, with the remainder of the deal made up of a 200 million euros bank loan maturing in 2028, the KBRA report said.KBRA said the revised structure included additional refinancing and interest rate risk and as a result it had downgraded the financing plan's rating from BBB+ to BBB, meaning it is less attractive to investors.A source at the club confirmed the revised debt structure but said the terms of the deal were still being negotiated with Goldman Sachs and that the definitive deal would be announced by Mar 31.Goldman Sachs has not replied to a request for more information about the ongoing talks and the new terms.Camp Nou is the largest football stadium in Europe and the fourth largest in the world by capacity with 99,354 seats but the club considers it no longer offers a full match-day experience for fans.The club estimates the new stadium will allow Barca to generate 200 million euros of additional revenue annually through sponsorship and naming rights, ticketing, catering, VIP boxes, hospitality, meetings and events.Barcelona have announced that Turkish construction company Limak will carry out the renovation and work will start in June.Club president Joan Laporta, who presided over one of Barca's most successful periods from 2003 to 2010, was re-elected two years ago after the previous board resigned due to the club's worsening finances and other issues.He inherited a club deep in a financial crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricted by LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, Barca were unable to agree a new deal with club great Lionel Messi, who left as a free agent to Paris St Germain in 2021.Since then Laporta has tried to improve the club's financial situation, turning the club's assets into cash and bringing in new sponsors.In March 2022, the club signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with audio streaming platform Spotify (SPOT.N) in an agreement worth 280 million euros.Barca have also agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in their La Liga TV rights for the next 25 years to US private equity group Sixth Street for 607.5 million euros and approved the sale of a minority share of their audio-visual division to Socios.com and Orpheus Media for 200 million.\",\n",

The bottle did not warn users about the risk of contamination from exposure to skin.Working with lab experts USADA established that such exposure would cause a positive test, the agency said.It therefore concluded Nash had no fault or negligence and would not be sanctioned.If she had not been cleared, Nash, who competed as a skier at two winter Olympics before switching to cycling, faced a four-year ban.\"As in this case, we always work as hard to try to exonerate the truly innocent as we do to convict those who intentionally cheat,\" said USADA boss Travis Tygart.USADA disclosed Nash\\'s no-fault violation in keeping with WADA rules but Tygart said the rules needed to change.\"If there is no question that an athlete comes into contact with a prohibited substance from a completely innocent source and there is no effect on performance, USADA continues to advocate that there should not be a violation or a public announcement,” he said.\"The rules must change and all of us must wake up and demand a more fair and just global anti-doping system that catches and sanctions intentional cheats who rob clean athletes but does not railroad innocent athletes.\"',\n",

       " 'LONDON : Chelsea boss Graham Potter looked like the most relieved man in London as he punched the air and blew kisses into the crowd after his struggling side\\'s 2-1 aggregate win over Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.Chelsea fans, many of whom had booed Potter loudly when defeat followed defeat in recent weeks, cheered the team off the pitch after a goal by Raheem Sterling and a re-taken penalty by Kai Havertz earned the Blues a 2-0 win on the night.That turned a 1-0 deficit in the first leg in Germany into a ticket for the quarter finals and kicked off celebrations that harked back to some of Chelsea\\'s great nights in Europe\\'s top competition over the past 20 years.For Potter, the victory was personal too.\"Inevitably in life, you are going to have bad times and you\\'re going to have good times,\" Potter told reporters when asked about how he felt after shouldering much of the blame for Chelsea\\'s bleak run of form that began as far back as October.\"Things are never bad forever, thankfully. But it felt like that sometimes,\" he said.Potter confirmed he had a quick post-match meeting with Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly who had been all smiles in the stands, wrapped in a blue and white scarf.\"I\\'m still here,\" Potter said about the outcome of the meeting, shrugging off with a laugh the speculation that his job was on the line depending on the result of Tuesday\\'s match.It was the biggest win yet for Chelsea\\'s new owners who paid 4.25 billion pounds ($5.03 billion) last year for the 2021 European champions.Since then, the consortium has invested more than 500 million pounds in new players, continuing the kind of lavish spending seen under the former owner of Stamford Bridge, Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, who was forced to relinquish the club after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine last year.Until Tuesday\\'s win, Boehly and the rest of the consortium had seen little return on their investment.Chelsea have slumped to 10th place in the English Premier League, with their chances of reaching next season\\'s Champions League via a top-four finish all but gone, and the team were eliminated early in both of England\\'s knockout cup competitions.The Blues struggled even to score during a miserable run of two wins in 15 games that was only ended last Saturday with a close-run 1-0 victory over struggling Leeds United.Potter, who had to fill the big shoes of Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel when the German was fired last September, again told reporters after Tuesday\\'s win that his job had been made harder by a long list of injuries in late 2022.But the former Brighton & Hove Albion coach went out of his way to praise Chelsea fans, saying he understood their frustrations and appreciated the atmosphere they created in Stamford Bridge against Dortmund.\"Big thanks to the supporters.

I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,\" Pioli said. \"We made it to the quarters, now let\\'s see what happens in the draw.\"THIRD GEARThe match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.Considering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.Tottenham\\'s three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.The Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.With the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.As Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.Kane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.Conte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.Kane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.',\n",

So it\\'s a different situation and I have to adjust to that,\" she told reporters at Indian Wells on Wednesday.\"On the other hand I\\'ve been number one for almost a year so I already have enough experience to deal with it.\"Learning to tune out the critics is another adjustment she has had to make.The 21-year-old said she was taken aback by the negativity that came with her loss in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships last month after she successfully defended her title in Doha.\"I lost in the final and people were surprised - not happy with the performance - and just critical,\" she said.\"It made me think that last year, before this huge streak and before winning all these tournaments, I would have been so happy with the result.\"But because of these comments right now, I felt like ooh, that\\'s not enough. I\\'m trying not to read those kinds of things because I\\'m happy with the work I\\'ve put in and how I played in Doha and Dubai.\"She said it\\'s an example of how the world around her has shifted.\"There is more pressure and expectation but I\\'m trying to deal with that the best way possible,\" she said.\"And I think I\\'m doing good.\"',\n",

Lineker described the policy as \"beyond awful\" and \"immeasurably cruel\".Lineker wrote on Twitter that the language used in the proposals was not dissimilar to that of Nazi Germany, forcing the BBC to have a \"frank conversation\" with the presenter after Braverman\\'s complaint.Lineker doubled down on Wednesday, saying he would continue to speak for those who had no voice.\"I have never known such love and support in my life than I\\'m getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly).
