I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,\" Pioli said. \"We made it to the quarters, now let\\'s see what happens in the draw.\"\\n\\nTHIRD GEAR\\n\\nThe match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.\\n\\nConsidering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.\\n\\nTottenham\\'s three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.\\n\\nThe Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.\\n\\nWith the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.\\n\\nAs Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.\\n\\nKane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.\\n\\nConte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.\\n\\nKane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.',\n",

The Spaniard also headed wide a little later but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry completed a quick break in the 89th minute.\\n\\n\"The best team won,\" PSG\\'s Danilo said. \"We missed a few chances, it\\'s hard to swallow.

So either we win it, which would not be easy, or try to qualify by finishing in the top four in Serie A,\" Pioli said.\\n\\nMilan have booked their spot in the last eight with Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Benfica, while the remaining four teams will be decided next week.\\n\\n\"We’ll be paired with a great opponent, but Tottenham are a big team too and we can always have our say.

I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.\"\\n\\nConte tried to talk about Tottenham\\'s last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.\\n\\n\"We played in the Europa Conference League last year and weren\\'t able to get out of the group stages. Now we took a step forward but it is not enough and if we want to be competitive,\" he said. \"We have to fight.\"\\n\\nTottenham have now failed to score in their last three games, losing in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United, to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and now barely laying a glove on an average Milan side.\\n\\nIn his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go \"step by step\".\\n\\n\"I think the situation is very clear. I always say the same things we need time and patience. We don\\'t have solid foundations to fight and win,\" Conte, who dragged Tottenham into fourth place in the Premier League last season, told reporters.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t make a miracle and I can understand the fans losing patience because for a long time Tottenham have not won anything,\" he said. \"I\\'m really sorry for the fans but we cannot invent the win.

There\\'s a lot of disappointment in the dressing room.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if it\\'s a lesson to be learned, but there\\'s a lot of frustration.

We did well in the first half, we felt we could match our opponents, but we didn\\'t put away our chances,\" said Galtier.\\n\\nInstead it was Bayern who opened the scoring when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting tapped-in in the 61st minute before a late second goal from Serge Gnabry sealed their win.\\n\\n\"We conceded what was a really stupid first goal at this level. Yes, there was pressure from Bayern, but sometimes you mustn\\'t be ashamed to play it long to get over the pressing,\" Galtier said.\\n\\n\"When you\\'re behind after an hour\\'s play, it\\'s difficult.\"\\n\\nHis team\\'s latest European failure - their fifth last-16 exit in seven years - adds pressure on Galtier, who refused to speculate on his future at the club.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a big disappointment but we have to swallow it.
