       "['The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.\\n\\nDuring the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.\\n\\nJust as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.\\n\\nMultiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.\\n\\nJames posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: “Fkn sucks!!!!”\\n\\nJust another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.\\n\\nWith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s play-in tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season?\\n\\nDennis Schröder of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots over Jonas Valančiūnas of the New Orleans Pelicans. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\\n\\nSteadily improving\\n\\nFor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.\\n\\nHeading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.\\n\\nCriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player.\\n\\nSo the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.\\n\\nTo the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.\\n\\nBut down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.\\n\\nMidseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.\\n\\nAfter Sunday’s win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our a*s.”\\n\\nSince the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.\\n\\nJames shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\\n\\nWhat are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?\\n\\nIn any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.\\n\\nBut following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp.\\n\\nThe play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.\\n\\nThe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.\\n\\nIt means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.\\n\\nAccording to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left.\\n\\nIt has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.\\n\\nTied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in – James’ injury permitting.\\n\\nWho knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.',\n",
       " 'It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.\\n\\nA professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.\\n\\nShe counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.\\n\\nThe film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.\\n\\n“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.\\n\\n“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”\\n\\nThe scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.\\n\\n“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.\\n\\nFelix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Reiner Bajo/Netflix\\n\\nFirst portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.\\n\\nPaterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.\\n\\nThe end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.\\n\\nIt has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.\\n\\nThe BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.\\n\\nA five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.\\n\\nThat was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.\\n\\nWith the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.\\n\\n“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”\\n\\nAfter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.\\n\\n“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”\\n\\nTriathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\\n\\nThe experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.\\n\\n“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”\\n\\nPaterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.\\n\\nAfter she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.\\n\\n“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.\\n\\n“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”\\n\\nOver the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.\\n\\n“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.\\n\\n“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”\\n\\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/Netflix\\n\\nWhether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”\\n\\nIt perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.\\n\\nThe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.\\n\\nAnd with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.\\n\\n“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.\\n\\nThe popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.\\n\\nWhatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.\\n\\n“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.\\n\\n“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”',\n",
       " 'Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.\\n\\nWith his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.\\n\\nHe is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.\\n\\n“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”\\n\\nLillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.\\n\\nLillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.\\n\\nHe made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.\\n\\nHe ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.\\n\\nLillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.\\n\\n“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”\\n\\nAny postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test. Steve Dykes/AP\\n\\nWith that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.\\n\\nLillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.\\n\\n“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.\\n\\nNot only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.\\n\\nThe Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive.

       " 'Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.\\n\\nFast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.\\n\\nDriven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.\\n\\nIn the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.\\n\\nFeaturing almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.\\n\\nThe friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.\\n\\nInitially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”\\n\\nAleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016. Apple TV+\\n\\nCharacters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.\\n\\nČeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.\\n\\n“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.\\n\\n“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”\\n\\n‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’\\n\\nBut the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.\\n\\nEven Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.\\n\\nPublic opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.\\n\\nAndrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association. Apple TV+\\n\\nThe documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.\\n\\n“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”\\n\\nBut Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.\\n\\n“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”\\n\\nThe entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.\\n\\nSo much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.\\n\\nReal Madrid won the 2022 Champions League. Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nIt epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.\\n\\n“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”\\n\\nEuropean governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.\\n\\nThe documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.\\n\\n‘The war for football rages on’\\n\\nStill the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.\\n\\nZimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.\\n\\n“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.\\n\\n“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”\\n\\nGiorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA. Apple TV+\\n\\nFor Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.\\n\\nJuventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.\\n\\nBarcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”\\n\\nBut Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”\\n\\n“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”\\n\\nMeanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.\\n\\nAn opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.\\n\\nThe ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.\\n\\nThe ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”',\n",

But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.\\n\\n“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.\\n\\nIn a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer.

       " 'During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.\\n\\nHe played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.\\n\\nBut for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.\\n\\n“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.\\n\\n“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”\\n\\nLast month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.\\n\\nThe response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”\\n\\n“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.\\n\\n“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”\\n\\nJohnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France. Phil Rees/Shutterstock\\n\\nOn top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.\\n\\nNow, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.\\n\\n“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.\\n\\n“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”\\n\\nThere are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.\\n\\nFormer referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.\\n\\nBoth Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.\\n\\nBut Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.\\n\\n“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.\\n\\n“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”\\n\\nJohnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.\\n\\nHe’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.\\n\\n“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.\\n\\n“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”\\n\\nAfter retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.\\n\\nHe recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.\\n\\n“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”',\n",

So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport.

But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.\\n\\nWhen asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”\\n\\nDjokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.\\n\\nThis week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.\\n\\nDjokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.\\n\\nHe next takes to the court at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which gets underway on February 27.',\n",
       " 'Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.\\n\\nNot so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.\\n\\nThe 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.\\n\\n“I was very nervous,” she tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.\\n\\n“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”\\n\\nNot to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.\\n\\n“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”\\n\\nThompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.\\n\\nIn front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.\\n\\nAlyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images\\n\\n“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”\\n\\nThompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.\\n\\nAnd the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.\\n\\nInspiring on and off the field\\n\\nThompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.\\n\\nDespite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.\\n\\n“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells CNN Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”\\n\\nThompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.\\n\\nGisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.\\n\\nAlyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off. Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\\n\\nThe pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.\\n\\nDespite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.\\n\\n“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.\\n\\nWhile making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.\\n\\nHaving tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.\\n\\nIt’s a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.\\n\\nBoth of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.\\n\\nHead coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.\\n\\n“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.\\n\\n“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”\\n\\nA slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine.',\n",

I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”\\n\\nKirk during the final round.

He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.\\n\\nA tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.\\n\\nWhen he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.\\n\\nA candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.\\n\\nKirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.\\n\\nFor Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory. Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.\\n\\n“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”\\n\\nAugusta calling\\n\\nOn Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.\\n\\nThe American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.\\n\\nFor both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.\\n\\nAgain, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.\\n\\nAs well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.\\n\\n“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.\\n\\n“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

       " 'It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.\\n\\nA nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.\\n\\n“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”\\n\\nKirk during the final round. Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\\n\\n‘I got sober because of you’\\n\\nOn the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.\\n\\n“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.\\n\\nBy that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.\\n\\nA tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.\\n\\nWhen he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.\\n\\nA candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.\\n\\nKirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to win and hard liquor such as wine, vodka, and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.\\n\\nFor Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory. Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.\\n\\n“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”\\n\\nAugusta calling\\n\\nOn Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.\\n\\nThe American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.\\n\\nFor both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.\\n\\nAgain, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.\\n\\nAs well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.\\n\\n“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.\\n\\n“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.\\n\\n“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said.',\n",
       " 'For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.\\n\\nWhen the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a “darkness retreat,” many were left scratching their heads.\\n\\n“It’s just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,” Rodgers said earlier this month. “We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I’m really looking forward to it.”\\n\\nRodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.”\\n\\nBut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?\\n\\nWhat happens in the dark\\n\\nA darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats, nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.\\n\\nThe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark. Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\n“The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,” said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.\\n\\n“When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,” Berman said. “In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love, forgiveness, peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.”\\n\\nThe center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident.\\n\\nThe cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person’s needs.\\n\\nParticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.\\n\\nEach space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\nBurak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.\\n\\n“It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,” said Dalcik. “There’s nothing New Age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can’t, you should probably get pretty curious about why.”\\n\\nBerman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles.\\n\\n“It’s not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,” Berman said. “But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves.”\\n\\nA therapeutic tool or junk science?\\n\\nFor now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.\\n\\n“That’s totally false,” said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. “There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.”\\n\\nDr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.\\n\\n“Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,” Malůš said.\\n\\nWhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.\\n\\nBerman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.\\n\\n“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you’ve come into the wrong place,” he said. “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.”\\n\\nFor those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.\\n\\n“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,” he said. “Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself.”',\n",

Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.\\n\\nIn the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.\\n\\nWhen it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.\\n\\nCasemiro celebrates scoring Manchester United's first goal in the Carabao Cup final.

It’s massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it’s something we’ve missed as a club,” Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.\\n\\n“The fact we’ve come all this way and won it, it’s a massive feeling.

       " 'Former Miami Dolphins head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ lawsuit against the NFL and three teams – the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants and the Houston Texans – can proceed instead of going to arbitration, a federal judge said on Wednesday.\\n\\nJudge Valerie Caproni issued the decision, allowing Flores to pursue his case against the three teams and the NFL through a court, though his suit against the Miami Dolphins and both Steve Wilks’ and Ray Horton’s cases will go through arbitration.\\n\\n“This case shines an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League (“NFL”) teams. Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,” Caproni wrote in her decision.\\n\\nFlores’ attorney Doug Wigdor said in a statement: “We are pleased that Coach Flores’ class claims of systematic discrimination against the NFL and several teams will proceed in court and ultimately before a jury of his peers.”\\n\\nLast year, Flores, who had recently been fired by the Miami Dolphins after three seasons as head coach, filed a federal civil lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring practices for head coaching jobs.\\n\\nFlores alleged in the suit that Dolphins’ owner Stephen Ross offered to pay him to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged him to purposely violate league tampering rules.\\n\\nWhen he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with “disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with,” the lawsuit states.\\n\\nThe Dolphins didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, though when Flores initiated his lawsuit just over a year ago the NFL team said: “We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization.”\\n\\n“The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.”\\n\\nFlores also accused the Giants and Broncos of carrying out sham interviews in order to comply with the “Rooney Rule,” which requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for open head coaching jobs.\\n\\nLast month he was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as a defensive coordinator after spending last season as senior defensive assistant/linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was noted by the Judge Caproni.\\n\\nIn her ruling, she also noted the league’s “long history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers – are incredibly troubling.”\\n\\n“Given the number of Black men who play and coach football, it is difficult to understand how it could be that, at the time Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit, ‘the NFL had only one Black Head Coach.’”\\n\\nThe Giants declined to comment, while CNN Sport has reached out to the Broncos and Texans for comment.\\n\\nNFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement to CNN: “Diversity and inclusion throughout the NFL make us a better organization. We recognize there is more work to be done and we are deeply committed to doing it.\\n\\n“That said, we are pleased with the court’s decision, which correctly holds that the vast majority of claims in this case are properly arbitrable by the Commissioner under binding agreements signed by each plaintiff.\\n\\n“We intend to move forward promptly with arbitrations as directed by the court and will seek to dismiss the remaining claims.”\\n\\nA pretrial conference is set for March 24.',\n",
       " 'FIFA’s decision to appoint Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima as its global fan ambassador ahead of the Women’s World Cup has been derided as “tone deaf” and “truly baffling” by former Australian international Moya Dodd.\\n\\nSoccer’s world governing body announced Monday that Lima, a former Victoria’s Secret model, would “develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives involving fans from all over the world,” while FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the 41-year-old Brazilian “lives and breathes ‘futebol.’”\\n\\nDodd, the former vice-captain of Australia’s women’s football team, said on Wednesday that Lima’s public image “looked an odd fit for an organisation that says it wants to empower girls and women, and whose President is required to be “a vanguard” for promoting gender equality (yes, that’s in the FIFA Governance Regulations).”\\n\\nDodd, who previously led Fifa’s taskforce on women’s football, wrote on Linkedin: “[W]hen a girl plays football, the world sees her differently. Instead of being complimented on her nice looks or her pretty dress, she is valued for her game-saving tackles and brilliant goal-scoring.\\n\\n“She’s admired for what she can DO, rather than how she looks, putting her on a more equal footing with her brothers in a way that can alter the whole trajectory of her life’s ambitions.\\n\\nDodd said that when a girl plays football, \"she\\'s admired for what she can DO, rather than how she looks\". Stuart Franklin/FIFA/Getty Images\\n\\nA member of the FIFA’s executive committee from 2013 to 2016, Dodd expanded on her comments, adding that her own research on Lima “showed that this model specifically was known for crash-diet eating & drinking,” and referenced a 2006 GQ article, where the Brazilian is quoted as saying abortion is a crime.\\n\\n“What will this ambassador represent to the large and growing population of aspirational #womensfootball players and fans who love the game because it shows us what empowerment and equality can look like?” asked Dodd.\\n\\nLima’s publicist, Laurent Boye, said the model’s stance had changed since she made those comments 17 years ago.\\n\\n“We can proudly say that Ms Lima has been promoting a healthy lifestyle for several years and like many people, her position on many LGBTQIA+ and women issues has evolved and she is considered an ally,” Boye said in a statement, Reuters news agency reported.\\n\\nIn a follow-up post, Dodd said that Lima’s view’s on abortion still hadn’t been addressed.\\n\\n“To be clear, there is no criticism of Lima’s personal choice - everyone should have that right. But denouncing abortion as a crime means that you think others who make a different choice should be treated as criminals and punished accordingly.\\n\\n“That is a terrifying prospect, and not consistent with women’s empowerment or right to control their own bodies and futures, imho,” Dodd wrote.\\n\\nCNN has reached out to FIFA for further comment.\\n\\nIn a statement Monday, Lima said she was ” very thankful and honoured to have been chosen by FIFA to be the first Global Fan Ambassador and to be given such a platform to help fans get even closer to the game.”\\n\\nOuarda Coussay, a representative for model management agency Elite World Group, which represents Lima, declined further comment when contacted by CNN.\\n\\nThe 2023 Women’s World Cup runs from July 20 to August 20 in Australia and New Zealand.',\n",
       " 'Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.\\n\\nIf the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.\\n\\nThe new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.\\n\\n“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.\\n\\n“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we’re going to have more of that.”\\n\\nWorld No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”\\n\\nUnveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.\\n\\nEligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.\\n\\nHowever, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.\\n\\nAnd with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.\\n\\nThough involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.\\n\\n“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.\\n\\n“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”\\n\\nThe new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.\\n\\n‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’\\n\\nDesignated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.\\n\\nThough still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.\\n\\nBankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.\\n\\nPIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.\\n\\n“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.\\n\\nThe inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022. Chris Trotman/LIV Golf/Getty Images\\n\\nAhead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.\\n\\nConsistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.\\n\\nAsked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.\\n\\n“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.\\n\\n“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.\\n\\nWhen Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.\\n\\n“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.\\n\\n“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.\\n\\n“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”\\n\\nMcIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\\n\\nScheffler: Money not a factor\\n\\nDiscussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.\\n\\n“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.\\n\\n“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.\\n\\n“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”\\n\\nIn response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.\\n\\n“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.\\n\\n“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”\\n\\nHoma’s ‘rant’\\n\\nPerhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.\\n\\nWhile he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.\\n\\n“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.\\n\\nAddressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.\\n\\n“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.\\n\\nHoma in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Michael Reaves/Getty Images\\n\\n“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.\\n\\n“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.\\n\\n“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.\\n\\n“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”\\n\\nAsked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.”',\n",
       " 'In July last year, Cameron Smith achieved golfing immortality.\\n\\nCompleting a dramatic late charge to clinch the 150th Open Championship at the legendary St. Andrews Old Course, the Australian could not have wished for a more magical way to secure his first major title.\\n\\nAnd yet, celebrations in Scotland were nothing compared to those in Brisbane four months later. A home city victory at the Australian PGA Championship in November put the cherry on top of the delicious cake that was 2022 for Smith.\\n\\n“That left a really good taste in the mouth for the end of the year,” the 29-year-old told CNN. “There was a few more people there and I think it was kind of a celebration of the year as well.\\n\\n“I think it was kind of always the plan to go out on that Sunday night and have a drink anyway. So for us to have the Kirkwood Cup there as well, something to drink out of, was awesome.”\\n\\nCameron Smith admires the Joe Kirkwood Cup following his victory at the Australian PGA Championship. Patrick Hamilton/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n‘I play my best golf when I have to be creative’\\n\\nViral footage of a pint-wielding Smith being lifted aloft in a nearby pub, gleefully rewatching his winning putt from hours earlier on a TV screen, painted a vivid picture of the extent of the celebrations.\\n\\nAnd to be fair, by November, he had enjoyed plenty of practice celebrating. Victory in Brisbane marked Smith’s fifth across all competitions in 2022, a year that had begun with a record-breaking lowest-ever score at the Tournament of Champions in January and was swiftly followed by a lucrative win at the Players Championship in March.\\n\\nHowever, on the eve of the Open Championship, Smith was enduring, by his own assessment, “a bit of a crappy run.” Having missed the cut at the US Open in June, a dismal second round at the subsequent Scottish Open had seen him barely make the cut.\\n\\nThat marked the peak of his “mid-season blues,” as Smith rebounded to finish tied 10th and tee up at St. Andrews a week later revitalized and in his element.\\n\\n“The town there is just so unique, everything’s about golf,” he said. “You don’t really get that anywhere else in the world.\\n\\n“It’s just such a cool place, and the course is so cool. Playing in those conditions, those windy, firm, fast conditions is something that I really enjoy … I play my best golf when I have to be creative.”\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameron Smith wins the 150th Open Championship 01:39 - Source: CNN\\n\\nAn electric start had seen Smith carry a two-stroke lead into the weekend, only for a disastrous Saturday to leave him four shots adrift of Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland heading into the deciding round.\\n\\nAs Smith made the turn, all eyes remained on the battle between the leading duo behind him. A run of five straight birdies later, he was the talk of a St. Andrews crowd – peppered with a contingent of rapturous Aussies – that sensed a spectacular story brewing.\\n\\nA final birdie at the 18th to pip playing partner Cameron Young by a stroke sealed a fitting end to a historic comeback win, the largest at St. Andrews since John Daly in 1995.\\n\\n“It was very surreal,” Smith recalled. “I think it’s something that you dream of and probably you don’t [even] get that far in your dreams.\\n\\n“There were Aussies screaming out, ‘Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!,’ all that stuff. It was just such an unreal moment.”\\n\\nSmith poses with the Claret Jug. Harry How/Getty Images\\n\\nWardrobe change\\n\\nTrue to form, Smith promised to celebrate by working out how many beers he could fit in the fabled trophy – two, by his initial estimate. The fact that he vowed to do the same with the Kirkwood Cup, is further evidence that success has not changed the World No. 5.\\n\\n“I feel as though I’m still the same person. Probably get recognized a little bit more in restaurants and stuff like that,” he said.\\n\\n“But I think if I change too much, my old man is still giving me a clip around the ear.”\\n\\nThough Smith will be targeting a wardrobe change for 2023. Specifically, a nice new green jacket.\\n\\nThe 87th edition of The Masters in April represents Smith’s first chance of the season to add another major title, at a fabled Augusta course where he maintains an excellent track record.\\n\\nSmith has four top-10 finishes in six starts at the major, peaking with a joint runner-up finish in 2020. At last year’s event, he finished tied for third, five shots behind first-time champion Scottie Scheffler.\\n\\nSmith in action at the 2022 Masters. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\\n\\n“I have a really good past there, a really good history,” Smith said.\\n\\n“I feel like those tournaments you win, you get a good kick here and there and it just hasn’t quite happened for whatever reason around there.\\n\\n“I feel like I’ve played my best golf by far at Augusta, I just haven’t won around there.”\\n\\nShaped like the clubhouse, the Masters trophy looks ill-suited for beer pouring. But rest assured, should Smith succeed this time around, the celebrations could well rival Brisbane regardless.',\n",

It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,” the Spaniard said ahead of the season’s start.\\n\\n“There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.”\\n\\nSuccess certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport’s history.\\n\\nSince then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.\\n\\nAston Martin is Alonso’s fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.\\n\\nThe frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.\\n\\nHe competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans’ 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nAlonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006. Mark Thompson/Getty Images\\n\\nThree years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.\\n\\nAfter finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.\\n\\n“The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,” he says of Aston Martin’s “wonderful project.”\\n\\nThe investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.\\n\\nThe team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.\\n\\nWith the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.\\n\\n2023 season set for more controversies\\n\\nThe 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.\\n\\nThe FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.\\n\\nThe 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.\\n\\nCurrent back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”\\n\\nAlonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1. Frank Augstein/AP\\n\\nWhen asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”\\n\\n“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.\\n\\n“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”\\n\\nWhile Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.\\n\\n“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”\\n\\nAlonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.\\n\\nHe is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.\\n\\nTwo decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.\",\n",

       " \"A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it’s still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout, arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.\\n\\nFor the fans, it’s excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar, one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.\\n\\nFor the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. “Love hurts,” goes the anonymous quote, “but not as much as penalties.”\\n\\nSuccess or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates’ hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, “It’s as if, for a few seconds, a player’s soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.”\\n\\nArgentina supporters cheer during the World Cup final against France. Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nVery few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can’t get enough of them.\\n\\n“A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,” he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. “It’s painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!”\\n\\nProfessor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He’s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.\\n\\nHe’s studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they’re doing.\\n\\n“The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,” the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never “only a lottery.”\\n\\nAurelien Tchouameni misses France's third penalty in the World Cup final. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nPenalties are more important than ever\\n\\nThe margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it’s in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer’s biggest prizes are being decided.\\n\\n“If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,” says Jordet, “you’re making a severe mistake if you’re not prepared for penalties.”\\n\\nIn 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.\\n\\nMohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout.

He’s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.\\n\\n“The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,” Jordet explained to CNN Sport. “It seems like they don’t know what to do. And then with other teams, it’s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.”\\n\\nJurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals. Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images\\n\\nLast season’s FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.\\n\\nThey spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea’s seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.\\n\\n“He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he’s done with the plan,” Jordet observed in a tweet thread, “Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.\\n\\n“There’s plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.”\\n\\nLiverpool’s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.\\n\\nChelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.\\n\\nWorld Cup Final penalty masterclass\\n\\nNobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet’s research has confirmed that the goalies aren’t just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.\\n\\nIn recent seasons, Argentina’s 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the “Machiavelli of football.”\\n\\nJordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.\\n\\nSince the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, “I can tell you’re nervous. I know where you’re going to shoot. Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up. Remember, I’m going to eat you up!”\\n\\nBut it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.\\n\\nJordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. “Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,” Jordet explained.\\n\\n“He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,” a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.\\n\\nArgentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\\n\\nFor the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.\\n\\nThis kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?\\n\\nJordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to “fully get to work.”\\n\\nMartínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.\\n\\nJordet notes that goalkeepers don’t typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.\\n\\n“We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.\\n\\n“In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.”\\n\\nBy the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.\\n\\nThe approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.\\n\\nFrance fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final. Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\\n\\nWhen the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.\\n\\nTchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.\\n\\nBy now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.\\n\\nMartínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.\\n\\n“Very calculated, creative, well executed,” Jordet concludes, “but of course also highly, highly cynical.”\\n\\nEmiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nMartínez showed very little remorse for his “cynical” actions. After the final he said, “”I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.”\\n\\n“All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.”\\n\\nSince the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.\\n\\nThis would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.\\n\\nShootouts don’t always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.\\n\\nJordet notes that when LAFC’s Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.\\n\\n“You’re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you’re a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.”\\n\\nLos Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.\\n\\nThe power of intangibles\\n\\nSome teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.\\n\\nEngland has lost seven of the 10 that it’s participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain’s loss to Morocco in 2022 means it’s now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.\\n\\nJordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren’t involved in it, you’re more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.\\n\\nHaving lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty in the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.\\n\\nMore and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet’s consultancy business for help.\\n\\n“I totally think there’s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,” Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.\\n\\n“I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.”\\n\\nThe Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nJordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He’s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.\\n\\n“I love penalty shootouts,” he says, “I think it’s the ultimate drama in football.”\\n\\nAnd yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn’t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.\\n\\n“The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you’re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.\\n\\n“TV producers aren’t always my friends,” Jordet concludes, “because they don’t look at what I like to look at.”\\n\\nBut now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they’re missing the best bits.\",\n",
       " \"Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.\\n\\nExcept the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.\\n\\nThe two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.\\n\\nBut on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.\\n\\nBenn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.\\n\\nDespite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.\\n\\nIn a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.\\n\\nCancellation\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.\\n\\nBenn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.\\n\\n“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.\\n\\n“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.\\n\\n“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.\\n\\nBenn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”\\n\\nBenn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.\\n\\nHe criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.\\n\\n“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”\\n\\nThe BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”\\n\\nIt added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.”\\n\\nIt pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, “the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC’s rules (and those of UKAD).”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.\\n\\nBenn punches Chris Algieri during their WBA Continental welterweight title fight on December 11, 2021. Alex Livesey/Getty Images\\n\\n‘Serious concerns’\\n\\nThe WBC’s February ruling stated that they had found there to be “no failures in the procedures” in relation to Benn’s sample and test.\\n\\nBut Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but “without explanation” was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.\\n\\nAccording to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test – which the World Anti-Doping Agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible.\\n\\nBenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\\n\\nBenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October’s test, adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error.”\\n\\nWhile Benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career, the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing.\\n\\n“Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.”\\n\\nBenn admitted that he’d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: “I didn’t think I’d see another day.”\\n\\n“It’s hurt me,” Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. “I didn’t think I was going to make it through this period. I didn’t think I was going to make it through.”\\n\\nWhen asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so – and it upsets me now because I don’t know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.\\n\\n“I was shamed for something I hadn’t even done. … If I had done something wrong, I’m human. I’d raise my hands to it, ‘I made a mistake,’ whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.\\n\\n“I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else’s incompetence. It’s been hard for the family.”\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAt the time of Benn’s positive test last year, the bout’s promoter, Matchroom, and that organization’s boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being “prohibited” by the BBBofC.\\n\\nHearn told the BBC at the time: “As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.\\n\\n“Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There’s lots going on with the lawyers.”\\n\\nEddie Hearn, boxing promoter of Matchroom boxing, speaks at the press conference ahead of Benn's scheduled fight with Eubank Jr. Alex Broadway/Getty Images\\n\\nAmid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.\\n\\nThe decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight’s money-making opportunities rather than the boxers’ safety.\\n\\nWeeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.\\n\\nBenn accused the BBBofC of conducting an “unfair and biased procedure.” He also disputes that he relinquished his license.\\n\\n“(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,” a statement said on Benn’s Twitter at the time.\\n\\nAnd a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not “engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.”\",\n",

Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nFlores says she trained for years as many women interested in boxing do in Cuba: on her own dime and in gyms lacking in even the most basic equipment.\\n\\nWhile they could learn and practice the sport as a hobby, the ban on women’s boxing meant Cuban female athletes could not take part in tournaments on the island or abroad.\\n\\nAt least officially, women’s boxing in Cuba did not exist.\\n\\nA new dawn\\n\\nIn December, the first cracks in that glass ceiling appeared when officials made an about face after announcing that they had obtained the proper safety equipment for them – such as padding and head gear.\\n\\n“We took this step when we were sure, really convinced that it was the moment and we didn’t have any concerns because our women would be protected,” Cuban Boxing Commission President Alberto Puig de la Barca told reporters at a news conference.\\n\\nThe change, sports officials said at the news conference, was also the result of a newly implemented family code on the island that said women were required by law to have the same opportunities as men. That apparently included boxing.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the first try outs were held at a cramped facility with a single boxing ring. Many of the women boxers had only recently switched from competing in martial arts or had merely dabbled in boxing.\\n\\nStill, they sparred with passion, drawing appreciative cheering and applause from spectators.\\n\\nAfter the first bout, an announcer exclaimed to the crowd of people watching, “This is historic!”\\n\\nCuban boxer Namibia Flores has fought for years for women's boxing to be recognized in Cuba.

       " 'For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.\\n\\nOr at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.\\n\\nThe matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it’s a ratio he is more than content with.\\n\\n“Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It’s the pinnacle of our sport, it’s what you’re judged by,” Koepka told CNN.\\n\\n“If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can’t tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person’s won or that person’s won, but they know exactly how many majors you’ve won.\\n\\n“So, to me, that’s what you’re defined by.”\\n\\n‘I love it when athletes get cocky’\\n\\nThey are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.\\n\\nKoepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It’s a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.\\n\\n“I’m pretty blunt, I don’t like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I’ve always been that way,” he said. “I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that’s how I feel.\\n\\n“I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves – I think that’s important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you’re doing.\\n\\n“If you feel you’re the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.”\\n\\nKoepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019. Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images\\n\\nAnd Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.\\n\\nOnly five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.\\n\\nKoepka’s current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 – albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.\\n\\nInjury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had “dislocated and shattered” his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.\\n\\nHis struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix’s new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series “Full Swing,” where Koepka admitted his slump was “the worst” he had ever suffered in his life.\\n\\n“There was a lot of stuff … just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,” Koepka told CNN.\\n\\n“The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you’re just sitting there. There’s a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you’ve just got to endure, just to make it better. It’s not always fun, not always glamorous.”\\n\\nKoepka struggled for form during 2022. Soobum Im/USA Today Network/Reuters\\n\\nHealth is wealth\\n\\nYet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.\\n\\nAlongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner’s earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.\\n\\nBrooks and Chase Koepka toast their victory at the LIV Golf Invitiational - Jeddah.

A self-confessed “slow starter,” he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.\\n\\nRunner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a “good” 2023.\\n\\n“Hopefully a few wins, and then a major – that’s the goal every year,” he said.',\n",

I would do that a hundred percent,” DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa Wednesday.\\n\\n“I think his people are looking at it, and I’m not sure that’s the way they want to come into the country, which I understand. I think it’d be a great moment, but you know, nevertheless.”\\n\\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director, proof of Covid-19 vaccination is required for non-U.S. citizens, non-immigrant passengers arriving from a foreign country to the US by air, though that applies to other forms of travel.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, DeSantis had called on US President Joe Biden to intervene and allow Djokovic to compete in the tournament.\\n\\n“The only thing keeping Novak Djokovic from participating in the Miami Open tennis tournament is President Biden’s misguided and unscientific COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreigner travelers,” DeSantis, who has separately vowed to permanently ban mandates related to coronavirus mitigation as he considers a presidential bid, said on Twitter.\\n\\n“Mr. President – lift your restrictions and let him compete,” he added.\\n\\nAustralian Open champion Novak Djokovic poses with the trophy. Carl Recine/Reuters\\n\\nRepublican Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida also urged the US president to allow Djokovic into the country to play.\\n\\n“On a question of regarding the vaccination requirement, I refer you to the CDC – are the ones who deal with that,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday.\\n\\nThe vaccine requirement, she said, “is still in place, and we expect everyone to abide by our country’s rule, whether as a participant or spectator.”\\n\\nUS Open organizers said on Friday that they and the United States Tennis Association were “hopeful” that Djokovic was successful in his petition.\\n\\n“Novak Djokovic is one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a six-time champion of the Miami Open,” the Miami Open said on Twitter on Friday.\\n\\n“We hope he is allowed entry into the country so Floridians have the opportunity to see him compete once again.”\\n\\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Djokovic and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.\\n\\n“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” the 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade last month.\\n\\n“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.\\n\\nDjokovic returned to the world No. 1 position when he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to win a record 10th Australian Open in January.\\n\\nIt was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.\\n\\nThe Miami Open’s main draw play starts March 22 and and the tournament nds April 2.',\n",
       " \"Facing three injuries, the Memphis Grizzlies have taken another player off their court. But this time, it’s due to police and NBA investigations into the team’s star player.\\n\\nThe Grizzlies lost their second straight game Tuesday without star guard Ja Morant, who is under investigation after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of Denver.\\n\\nMorant has apologized for his actions via his representation on Saturday, after Memphis announced he would be away from the team.\\n\\nMorant said he would take time away “to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.”\\n\\nMemphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said Sunday there is no timetable for Morant’s return. The team tweeted Wednesday that Morant will miss at least four more games, meaning he will return no earlier than March 17.\\n\\nMorant is averaging 27.1 points per game in his fourth NBA season.\\n\\nThe Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows Morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.\\n\\nThe police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said Wednesday the agency won’t recommend charges against Morant.\\n\\n“(The department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. In this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any type,” department officials said in a statement.\\n\\nNo one made a complaint and investigators concluded no one was threatened or menaced with a gun, police said.\\n\\nThe league is also investigating the two-time All-Star point guard and the video, an NBA spokesperson told CNN.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Most exciting young star' away from NBA court after gun controversy 02:04 - Source: CNN\\n\\nIt’s unknown why Morant was carrying a gun or if it was his. The Grizzlies played in Houston against the Rockets on March 1 before heading to Denver for a game against the Nuggets on March 3.\\n\\nIf Morant did bring the gun onto team facilities – which also includes the team plane – he is subject to NBA discipline according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\\n\\nThe CBA states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while “physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player’s Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity”\\n\\nIf a player is in violation of the ruling in the CBA, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.\\n\\n“The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the Association,” the CBA reads.\\n\\nWhile it is unclear what punishment Morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when Gilbert Arenas, a three-time All-Star, was suspended until the end of the season – 50 games – for bringing unloaded guns into his team’s locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.\\n\\nArenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate Javaris Crittenton – who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident – over money in a poker game.\\n\\nThe US government said at the time that Arenas brought at least one firearm into the Washington Wizards’ locker room.\\n\\nArenas would later return to the Wizards, while Crittenton was released by Washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in August 2011. In April 2015, Crittenton plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 23 years in prison.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Grizzlies are not having a great time of it on the court. Their 112-103 defeat by the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena in LA on Tuesday came two days after losing in the same building to the Los Angeles Clippers.\\n\\nLakers forward Troy Brown Jr. is fouled by Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies as he attempts a layup. Harry How/Getty Images\\n\\nJaren Jackson Jr. led the way for the Grizzlies, finishing with 26 points, but it wasn’t enough as a dominant Anthony Davis – who racked up 30 points and 22 rebounds – and 17 points each for Dennis Schröder, Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves led the surging Lakers to a seventh win in 10 games as they attempt to make the playoffs.\\n\\nStill, the Grizzlies sit third in the Western Conference with a 38-26 record.\",\n",
       " 'UEFA plans to refund all Liverpool supporters who had tickets for the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris, the governing body of European soccer announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nLast year’s final was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.\\n\\nThere was widespread criticism about the way fans were treated at the game, with UK Member of Parliament Ian Byrne – who was at the match as a Liverpool fan – describing the situation outside the stadium as “one of the most horrendous experiences of my life.”\\n\\nA UEFA statement on the refund said: “UEFA will implement a special refund scheme for fans who were most affected when accessing the Stade de France on 28 May 2022.\\n\\n“Refunds will be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z where the most difficult circumstances were reported.\\n\\n“Given these criteria, the special refund scheme covers all of the Liverpool FC ticket allocation for the Final, i.e. 19,618 tickets.”\\n\\nUEFA noted that Real Madrid fans and neutral supporters affected while accessing the stadium can also claim refunds, depending on whether they meet the criteria.\\n\\nPolice patrol inside the Stade de France during the 2022 Champions League Final. Dylan Martinez/Reuters\\n\\nAn independent review commissioned by UEFA found that the organization bears “primary responsibility” for circumstances which almost caused the event to turn into a “mass fatality catastrophe.”\\n\\n“We recognize the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and, with this scheme, we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium,” UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said.\\n\\n“We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair.\\n\\n“We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organizations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period,” Theodoridis added.\\n\\nSpirit of Shankly (SOS) issued a statement in conjunction with the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Society, reading: “We welcome today’s announcement from UEFA. This unprecedented move is the result of tireless work, alongside FSE (Football Supporters Europe) and Ian Byrne MP, to hold those responsible for the catastrophic events in Paris.\\n\\n“With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledging their part in the fiasco. But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.\\n\\n“We will work alongside Liverpool and publish details once we know how and when refunds will be processed.”\\n\\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Tony Winterburn – a partner at Pogust Goodhead, the law firm running the case against UEFA on behalf of Liverpool fans who attended the Champions League final – said the refund scheme is insufficient compensation.\\n\\n“Digesting the fine details of this scheme will allow us to determine if it is, in fact, ‘comprehensive and fair’. Although this does present as a step towards UEFA accepting responsibility for the events, our legal case is still progressing,” Winterburn said.\\n\\n“It is pertinent the extent of the physical and psychological injuries of our clients remains at the forefront of this process.\\n\\n“We believe the term ‘refund,’ in its broadest sense, does not go far enough in providing redress or acknowledging the true harm suffered by those at an event that should have been safe for all to attend.”',\n",

       " 'More than a year after US Soccer and the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) brokered a landmark equal pay agreement, USWNT star player and two-time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe is still coming to terms with the implications of what her team has achieved.\\n\\nFollowing years of lawsuits and lobbying from players, the Federation last year agreed to a new 50-50 split in the way it pays men and women competing for the US national soccer teams, meaning both sides will receive the same pay and prize money, including for participating at World Cups.\\n\\n“There was a relentlessness, and a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved,” Rapinoe told WBD sports analyst Julie Foudy, adding she’s proud of “the group effort that it took.”\\n\\n“It was almost like we couldn’t lose, I said that a lot. If the Federation won, everybody loses and if we win, everybody wins,” the two-time World Cup champion added.\\n\\nRapinoe said the team worked together and saw setbacks, not as losses, but as “just a step on the journey. Ultimately, I think that gave us a lot of confidence on the field as well – we were all in it together, we were all doing our part.”\\n\\nThe USWNT fought for the agreement for years, through lawsuits and lobbying. Sam Hodde/Getty Images\\n\\n“There’s something about feeling desperate that is really powerful, and I think, at times, we were,” she added, saying the team felt an immense pressure to win the Women’s World Cup in 2019 while battling to prove their worth off the field – they did, defending their 2015 title, beating The Netherlands in the final thanks to goals from Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle.\\n\\n“We obviously want[ed] to win, professionally, as your sport, but there was some understanding of desperation there. We have this opportunity to grasp this moment, and I think [with] the combination of personalities, we knew that and we rose to that occasion,” she said.\\n\\nThe agreement has already changed the way remuneration works in US Soccer: the USWNT earned more money from its male equivalent reaching the knockout stages of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar than it did from winning its own tournaments in 2015 and 2019.\\n\\nIt also means the USMNT will pick up half of the USWNT’s prize money in the future.\\n\\nRipple effect\\n\\nRapinoe reflected that when fighting for equal pay, the women’s team had a unique opportunity to make change as a collective, which in turn inspired women around the world who were having to push for changes on their own.\\n\\n“What we’re most proud of is that it’s been something that people can see themselves in and gain confidence from,” she said.\\n\\n“We’re in a really unique and special situation to be around a bunch of other elite women: that almost never happens,” she explained.\\n\\nThe agreement, Rapinoe reflected, came as part of \"a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved.\" Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n“If you’re the best at what you do, normally you’re one of one, or one of a few if you’re in a company, or if you’re in a C-suite position, most likely, you’re one of one or one of two. It’s not very often that you have 20-something women that are able to do that, so I think that women put themselves in there with us.”\\n\\nRapinoe said she has heard stories of women who asked for a raise based on the team’s success.\\n\\n“It’s almost like they’re… getting that imagery of all of us standing behind them and having that confidence.\\n\\n“We kind of realized early on that this was such a bigger movement that we were a part of. Yes, we’re one of the sort of ‘out front’ main players, even just in the soccer world or in the women’s sports world in general, we were a part of something so much bigger.\\n\\n“I think other women who don’t necessarily have the ability to have a bunch of other women around them saw themselves in us and were able to use that as motivation and be on our team,” she said.',\n",

If I entered the event, it’s always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it’s probably sooner rather than later, but wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that’s not in my DNA.”\\n\\nWoods started the tournament Thursday with a 2-under par 69, with birdies on his final three holes. He was five shots back of tournament leaders Max Homa and Keith Mitchell.\\n\\nWoods in action at Riviera Country Club in 1992.

While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.\\n\\n“I can still hit shots, but it’s the walking endurance that’s hard,” he said.\\n\\n“That’s something that we’ve had to work on, walking distances on the beach, just basically stress it out but also be able to recover by the next day and see how it is inflammation-wise and then keep practicing.\\n\\n“I may have overdone it a couple times here or there, but here I am.”\\n\\nWoods putts at the Pro-Am event ahead of the tournament.

His victory at the 2019 ZOZO Championship tied legendary compatriot Sam Snead for the all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins, meaning that one more triumph would see Woods become the outright leader.\\n\\nSnead’s feat was a benchmark that once seemed insurmountable until a prodigious talent emerged at the turn of the century. Sound familiar? Earlier this month, LeBron James sunk his 38,388th career point to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.\\n\\n“What he [James] accomplished is absolutely incredible – just the durability, the consistency and the longevity,” Woods said.\\n\\n“I grew up watching Kareem here … that record we never thought it would be surpassed. What LeBron is doing – but also the amount of minutes he’s playing – no one’s ever done that at that age, to be able to play all five positions, that’s never been done before at this level for this long.\\n\\n“As far as our equivalent to that, I don’t know, maybe you look at maybe me and Sam [Snead] at 82? It takes a career to get to those numbers. That’s how I think probably best how you look at it.”\\n\\nWoods is one win away from surpassing Snead's record.

The victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.\\n\\n“Tiger means so much to us as players out here on Tour and he’s done so much for us out here that it’s fun for us to be able to see him still continue to do what he loves,” he told reporters Tuesday.\\n\\n“It was pretty scary a few years ago when he got in that accident and we didn’t know if he was going to be able to do this again, and so just to have him out here on the grounds and to see him around doing what he loves to do is a lot of fun for us.”\\n\\nA new look PGA Tour\\n\\nA $3.6 million winner’s reward will be up for grabs, though defending champion Joaquin Niemann will not be in California to defend his title.

We need to produce the best product we possibly can to sell to all the viewerships.\\n\\n“It’s about us creating the best products so we have more eyes on it, more stars, people want to come out and either watch the game of golf, participate, either on social media or the different streaming platforms,” he added.\\n\\nWoods in action at the 2020 Genesis Invitational. Tim Bradbury/Getty Images\\n\\nSpeaking Wednesday, McIlroy said the feedback he had received about the designated events echoed what Woods had heard.\\n\\n“It’s the top half of the membership being really happy that they’re in them and… but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they’re always going to be on the outside looking in,” McIroy told reporters.\\n\\n“I think that the big thing has been, ‘Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week?’ And it’s not. This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That’s not going to be taken away.\\n\\n“It’s just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that’s a good thing. Like I’m not saying that we’re going to have field sizes of 50, it’s going to be closer to what you’ve seen in the past. We’re not trying to limit opportunities out here, but we also want to make sure that when people get opportunities, it’s the most competitive, most competitive tournaments and the most competitive product that we can put out there.”\",\n",

Jon Super/AP\\n\\nNow on 129 league goals, Salah overtakes legendary striker Robbie Fowler having played 61 fewer games.\\n\\nSalah himself admitted the record was very special to him but said he wouldn’t get carried away with the achievement.\\n\\n“It’s very special, I can’t lie,” he told reporters. “This record was in my mind since I came here.\\n\\n“I think after my first season I was always chasing that record. To beat it today against United with that result is unbelievable.\\n\\n“I’m going home to celebrate with the family, have a camomile tea and sleep.”\\n\\nDespite the result, United still sits seven points ahead of Liverpool in the league, but the latter moves just three points behind Tottenham in the fourth and final Champions League place with a game in hand.\\n\\nTen Hag will be hoping his side is resilient enough to shake off the disappointment as it faces Real Betis in the Europa League on Thursday.\",\n",
       " 'Police in Colorado are investigating Memphis Grizzlies All-Star guard Ja Morant after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub, authorities said Monday.\\n\\nThe Glendale Police Department said it’s “aware of the incident circulating on the internet involving an NBA player at a nightclub with a what appears to be a gun in the early morning hours of March 4, 2023.”\\n\\n“We have confirmed the incident took place at a bar in Glendale and we are investigating the matter. The Glendale Police Department does not comment on ongoing investigations,” the department said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows the 23-year-old briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while reportedly listening to music at a nightclub, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\\n\\nMorant later apologized via his representation for the video and said he would “take some time away to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.”\\n\\nThe star point guard’s Instagram and Twitter accounts were deactivated soon after.\\n\\nMemphis Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins had said Sunday that there is no timetable for Morant to return to the team, after the Grizzlies earlier announced the basketball player would “be away from the team for at least the next two games.”\\n\\n“There’s not a definitive timeline,” Jenkins said while speaking to reporters before Sunday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\\n\\n“We have said that it’ll be at least these two games. We are taking it a day at a time. This is going to be an ongoing healing process. I can’t comment on the terms of the exact timetable is going to be because this really isn’t a timetable situation.”\\n\\nThe league is investigating the star point guard and the video, an NBA spokesperson told CNN.\\n\\nJenkins said Morant understood he’s made some “difficult decisions and poor decisions in the past.”\\n\\n“That’s why you see in his statement – it speaks for itself. He understands he’s got to get help to get to a better place, not just for himself but also for his team,” Jenkins said.\\n\\n“He’s definitely embracing the mistakes that he’s made but only time will tell. We are going to support him and we are going to hold him accountable to make those changes.”\\n\\nWhen asked about how the team felt about the video, Jenkins said they take it “very seriously.”\\n\\nMorant looks on during a game against the Denver Nuggets on March 3. Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images\\n\\n“There are two elements to this I want to make very clear,” Jenkins said. “There’s a supportive element. Someone that’s got to get better and needs some help. And then also there’s accountability to the team that we got to stand for.\\n\\n“Obviously, nationwide – league-wide – there’s a lot of attention on gun violence. For us internally on this matter, that’s the stance we’ve taken on this about how we can support Ja throughout this growth opportunity. It’s a learning opportunity. Hopefully, we can be better from it.”\\n\\nJenkins reiterated the team will continue to support Morant through the process.\\n\\n“We love him. We want what’s best for him. We support him. It’s going to be a difficult process, but we got a great group to get through this,” Jenkins added.\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Morant, who participated in his second All-Star game last month, is averaging 27.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game this season.\\n\\nFollowing tonight’s game, Memphis is scheduled to play the Lakers in Los Angeles on Tuesday before returning home to host the Golden State Warriors on Thursday.']"

       "['The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.\\n\\nDuring the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.\\n\\nJust as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.\\n\\nMultiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.\\n\\nJames posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: “Fkn sucks!!!!”\\n\\nJust another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.\\n\\nWith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s play-in tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season?\\n\\nDennis Schröder of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots over Jonas Valančiūnas of the New Orleans Pelicans. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\\n\\nSteadily improving\\n\\nFor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.\\n\\nHeading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.\\n\\nCriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player.\\n\\nSo the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.\\n\\nTo the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.\\n\\nBut down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.\\n\\nMidseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.\\n\\nAfter Sunday’s win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our a*s.”\\n\\nSince the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.\\n\\nJames shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\\n\\nWhat are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?\\n\\nIn any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.\\n\\nBut following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp.\\n\\nThe play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.\\n\\nThe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.\\n\\nIt means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.\\n\\nAccording to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left.\\n\\nIt has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.\\n\\nTied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in – James’ injury permitting.\\n\\nWho knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.',\n",
       " 'It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.\\n\\nA professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.\\n\\nShe counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.\\n\\nThe film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.\\n\\n“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.\\n\\n“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”\\n\\nThe scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.\\n\\n“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.\\n\\nFelix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Reiner Bajo/Netflix\\n\\nFirst portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.\\n\\nPaterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.\\n\\nThe end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.\\n\\nIt has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.\\n\\nThe BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.\\n\\nA five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.\\n\\nThat was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.\\n\\nWith the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.\\n\\n“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”\\n\\nAfter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.\\n\\n“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”\\n\\nTriathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\\n\\nThe experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.\\n\\n“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”\\n\\nPaterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.\\n\\nAfter she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.\\n\\n“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.\\n\\n“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”\\n\\nOver the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.\\n\\n“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.\\n\\n“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”\\n\\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/Netflix\\n\\nWhether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”\\n\\nIt perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.\\n\\nThe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.\\n\\nAnd with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.\\n\\n“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.\\n\\nThe popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.\\n\\nWhatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.\\n\\n“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.\\n\\n“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”',\n",
       " 'Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.\\n\\nWith his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.\\n\\nHe is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.\\n\\n“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”\\n\\nLillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.\\n\\nLillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.\\n\\nHe made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.\\n\\nHe ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.\\n\\nLillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.\\n\\n“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”\\n\\nAny postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test. Steve Dykes/AP\\n\\nWith that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.\\n\\nLillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.\\n\\n“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.\\n\\nNot only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.\\n\\nThe Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.\\n\\nThe Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.',\n",
       " 'Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.\\n\\nFast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.\\n\\nDriven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.\\n\\nIn the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.\\n\\nFeaturing almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.\\n\\nThe friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.\\n\\nInitially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”\\n\\nAleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016. Apple TV+\\n\\nCharacters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.\\n\\nČeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.\\n\\n“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.\\n\\n“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”\\n\\n‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’\\n\\nBut the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.\\n\\nEven Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.\\n\\nPublic opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.\\n\\nAndrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association. Apple TV+\\n\\nThe documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.\\n\\n“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”\\n\\nBut Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.\\n\\n“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”\\n\\nThe entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.\\n\\nSo much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.\\n\\nReal Madrid won the 2022 Champions League. Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\n\\nIt epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.\\n\\n“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”\\n\\nEuropean governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.\\n\\nThe documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.\\n\\n‘The war for football rages on’\\n\\nStill the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.\\n\\nZimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.\\n\\n“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.\\n\\n“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”\\n\\nGiorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA. Apple TV+\\n\\nFor Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.\\n\\nJuventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.\\n\\nBarcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”\\n\\nBut Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”\\n\\n“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”\\n\\nMeanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.\\n\\nAn opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.\\n\\nThe ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.\\n\\nThe ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.\\n\\n“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”',\n",

It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.\\n\\nPalestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.\\n\\nPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.\\n\\nTo play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.\\n\\nThe president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”\\n\\nIn a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.\\n\\nThis can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.\\n\\nIn 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners.

But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.\\n\\n“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.\\n\\nIn a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”\\n\\nDespite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.\\n\\nWith players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.\\n\\nDaboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.\\n\\n“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months.

In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”\\n\\nAs a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.\\n\\nIn June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.\\n\\nA particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.\\n\\nMidway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.\\n\\nIn a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”\\n\\n“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.\\n\\n“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”\\n\\nThe IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.\\n\\nKremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible.

I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”\\n\\nLast month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.\\n\\nThe response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”\\n\\n“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.\\n\\n“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”\\n\\nJohnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.\\n\\nNow, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.\\n\\n“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.\\n\\n“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”\\n\\nThere are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.\\n\\nFormer referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.\\n\\nBoth Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.\\n\\nBut Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.\\n\\n“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.\\n\\n“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”\\n\\nJohnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.\\n\\nHe’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.\\n\\n“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.\\n\\n“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”\\n\\nAfter retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.\\n\\nHe recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.\\n\\n“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”',\n",

The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.\\n\\nBoth of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.\\n\\nHead coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.\\n\\n“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.\\n\\n“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”\\n\\nA slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine.',\n",

I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”\\n\\nKirk during the final round. Douglas P.

He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.\\n\\nA tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.\\n\\nWhen he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.\\n\\nA candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.\\n\\nKirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.\\n\\nFor Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory. Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.\\n\\n“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”\\n\\nAugusta calling\\n\\nOn Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.\\n\\nThe American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.\\n\\nFor both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.\\n\\nAgain, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.\\n\\nAs well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.\\n\\n“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.\\n\\n“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.\\n\\n“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said.',\n",

That instance right there shows you what could happen.”\\n\\nSpeeding things up\\n\\nThe new MLB rules are designed to speed up play, with baseball games taking an average of more than three hours to finish.\\n\\nThey dictate that pitchers have 15 seconds to complete a delivery with bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on bases. In addition, batters will be limited to one timeout per plate appearance, and there will also be a 30-second timer between hitters.\\n\\nNew regulations also mean the size of the three bases have grown from 15 inches to 18 inches in the hope of reducing injuries.\\n\\nIf the new rules for the 2023 season are going to usher in a new, faster era for the sport, then it looks likely that players are going to need time to adapt.\\n\\nHowever, the changes are being welcomed by some.\\n\\n“If this is going to be the pace of these games, I’m OK with it,” Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “First look, so far, so good.”\\n\\nTeams have the remaining of the preseason to make mistakes before more is at stake when the season starts for real on March 30.

I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”\\n\\nKirk during the final round.

He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.\\n\\nA tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.\\n\\nWhen he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.\\n\\nA candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.\\n\\nKirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to win and hard liquor such as wine, vodka, and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.\\n\\nFor Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory. Douglas P.

It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”\\n\\nAugusta calling\\n\\nOn Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.\\n\\nThe American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.\\n\\nFor both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.\\n\\nAgain, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.\\n\\nAs well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.\\n\\n“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.\\n\\n“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

       " 'For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.\\n\\nWhen the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a “darkness retreat,” many were left scratching their heads.\\n\\n“It’s just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,” Rodgers said earlier this month. “We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I’m really looking forward to it.”\\n\\nRodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.”\\n\\nBut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?\\n\\nWhat happens in the dark\\n\\nA darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats, nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.\\n\\nThe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark. Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\n“The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,” said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.\\n\\n“When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,” Berman said. “In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love, forgiveness, peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.”\\n\\nThe center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident.\\n\\nThe cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person’s needs.\\n\\nParticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.\\n\\nEach space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\nBurak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.\\n\\n“It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,” said Dalcik. “There’s nothing New Age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can’t, you should probably get pretty curious about why.”\\n\\nBerman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles.\\n\\n“It’s not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,” Berman said. “But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves.”\\n\\nA therapeutic tool or junk science?\\n\\nFor now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.\\n\\n“That’s totally false,” said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. “There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.”\\n\\nDr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.\\n\\n“Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,” Malůš said.\\n\\nWhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.\\n\\nBerman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.\\n\\n“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you’ve come into the wrong place,” he said. “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.”\\n\\nFor those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.\\n\\n“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,” he said. “Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself.”',\n",

So we’re going to have more of that.”\\n\\nWorld No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”\\n\\nUnveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.\\n\\nEligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.\\n\\nHowever, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.\\n\\nAnd with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.\\n\\nThough involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.\\n\\n“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.\\n\\n“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”\\n\\nThe new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.\\n\\n‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’\\n\\nDesignated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.\\n\\nThough still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.\\n\\nBankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.\\n\\nPIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.\\n\\n“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.\\n\\nThe inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022. Chris Trotman/LIV Golf/Getty Images\\n\\nAhead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.\\n\\nConsistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.\\n\\nAsked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.\\n\\n“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.\\n\\n“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.\\n\\nWhen Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.\\n\\n“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.\\n\\n“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.\\n\\n“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”\\n\\nMcIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\\n\\nScheffler: Money not a factor\\n\\nDiscussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.\\n\\n“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.\\n\\n“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.\\n\\n“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”\\n\\nIn response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.\\n\\n“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.\\n\\n“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”\\n\\nHoma’s ‘rant’\\n\\nPerhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.\\n\\nWhile he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.\\n\\n“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.\\n\\nAddressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.\\n\\n“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.\\n\\nHoma in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Michael Reaves/Getty Images\\n\\n“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.\\n\\n“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.\\n\\n“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.\\n\\n“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”\\n\\nAsked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.”',\n",
       " 'In July last year, Cameron Smith achieved golfing immortality.\\n\\nCompleting a dramatic late charge to clinch the 150th Open Championship at the legendary St. Andrews Old Course, the Australian could not have wished for a more magical way to secure his first major title.\\n\\nAnd yet, celebrations in Scotland were nothing compared to those in Brisbane four months later. A home city victory at the Australian PGA Championship in November put the cherry on top of the delicious cake that was 2022 for Smith.\\n\\n“That left a really good taste in the mouth for the end of the year,” the 29-year-old told CNN. “There was a few more people there and I think it was kind of a celebration of the year as well.\\n\\n“I think it was kind of always the plan to go out on that Sunday night and have a drink anyway. So for us to have the Kirkwood Cup there as well, something to drink out of, was awesome.”\\n\\nCameron Smith admires the Joe Kirkwood Cup following his victory at the Australian PGA Championship. Patrick Hamilton/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n‘I play my best golf when I have to be creative’\\n\\nViral footage of a pint-wielding Smith being lifted aloft in a nearby pub, gleefully rewatching his winning putt from hours earlier on a TV screen, painted a vivid picture of the extent of the celebrations.\\n\\nAnd to be fair, by November, he had enjoyed plenty of practice celebrating. Victory in Brisbane marked Smith’s fifth across all competitions in 2022, a year that had begun with a record-breaking lowest-ever score at the Tournament of Champions in January and was swiftly followed by a lucrative win at the Players Championship in March.\\n\\nHowever, on the eve of the Open Championship, Smith was enduring, by his own assessment, “a bit of a crappy run.” Having missed the cut at the US Open in June, a dismal second round at the subsequent Scottish Open had seen him barely make the cut.\\n\\nThat marked the peak of his “mid-season blues,” as Smith rebounded to finish tied 10th and tee up at St. Andrews a week later revitalized and in his element.\\n\\n“The town there is just so unique, everything’s about golf,” he said. “You don’t really get that anywhere else in the world.\\n\\n“It’s just such a cool place, and the course is so cool. Playing in those conditions, those windy, firm, fast conditions is something that I really enjoy … I play my best golf when I have to be creative.”\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameron Smith wins the 150th Open Championship 01:39 - Source: CNN\\n\\nAn electric start had seen Smith carry a two-stroke lead into the weekend, only for a disastrous Saturday to leave him four shots adrift of Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland heading into the deciding round.\\n\\nAs Smith made the turn, all eyes remained on the battle between the leading duo behind him. A run of five straight birdies later, he was the talk of a St. Andrews crowd – peppered with a contingent of rapturous Aussies – that sensed a spectacular story brewing.\\n\\nA final birdie at the 18th to pip playing partner Cameron Young by a stroke sealed a fitting end to a historic comeback win, the largest at St. Andrews since John Daly in 1995.\\n\\n“It was very surreal,” Smith recalled. “I think it’s something that you dream of and probably you don’t [even] get that far in your dreams.\\n\\n“There were Aussies screaming out, ‘Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!,’ all that stuff. It was just such an unreal moment.”\\n\\nSmith poses with the Claret Jug. Harry How/Getty Images\\n\\nWardrobe change\\n\\nTrue to form, Smith promised to celebrate by working out how many beers he could fit in the fabled trophy – two, by his initial estimate. The fact that he vowed to do the same with the Kirkwood Cup, is further evidence that success has not changed the World No. 5.\\n\\n“I feel as though I’m still the same person. Probably get recognized a little bit more in restaurants and stuff like that,” he said.\\n\\n“But I think if I change too much, my old man is still giving me a clip around the ear.”\\n\\nThough Smith will be targeting a wardrobe change for 2023. Specifically, a nice new green jacket.\\n\\nThe 87th edition of The Masters in April represents Smith’s first chance of the season to add another major title, at a fabled Augusta course where he maintains an excellent track record.\\n\\nSmith has four top-10 finishes in six starts at the major, peaking with a joint runner-up finish in 2020. At last year’s event, he finished tied for third, five shots behind first-time champion Scottie Scheffler.\\n\\nSmith in action at the 2022 Masters. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\\n\\n“I have a really good past there, a really good history,” Smith said.\\n\\n“I feel like those tournaments you win, you get a good kick here and there and it just hasn’t quite happened for whatever reason around there.\\n\\n“I feel like I’ve played my best golf by far at Augusta, I just haven’t won around there.”\\n\\nShaped like the clubhouse, the Masters trophy looks ill-suited for beer pouring. But rest assured, should Smith succeed this time around, the celebrations could well rival Brisbane regardless.',\n",

Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.\\n\\nThe team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.\\n\\nWith the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.\\n\\n2023 season set for more controversies\\n\\nThe 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.\\n\\nThe FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.\\n\\nThe 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.\\n\\nCurrent back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”\\n\\nAlonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1. Frank Augstein/AP\\n\\nWhen asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”\\n\\n“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.\\n\\n“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”\\n\\nWhile Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.\\n\\n“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”\\n\\nAlonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.\\n\\nHe is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.\\n\\nTwo decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.\",\n",

However, he retired following his second season in the league over a money dispute and returned to Spartanburg, South Carolina where he started a career in business.\\n\\nRichardson became the first former NFL player to own a team since George Halas when the league awarded Carolina a franchise in 1993. The Panthers inaugural season was in 1995.\\n\\nIn December 2017, Richardson announced that he would sell his principal stake after the team started investigating him for “workplace misconduct.”\\n\\nIn 2018, David Tepper, founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, agreed to purchase the team for a reported $2.2 billion, according to the Charlotte Observer.\\n\\n“Jerry Richardson’s contributions to professional football in the Carolinas are historic,” Panthers owners David and Nicole Tepper said in a statement. “With the arrival of the Panthers in 1995, he changed the landscape of sports in the region and gave the NFL fans here a team to call their own.\\n\\n“He was incredibly gracious to me when I purchased the team, and for that I am thankful.

This followed the receipt of two complaints with civil action regarding Mr Benabderrahmane,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN but did not name Al-Khelaifi.\\n\\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to CNN Wednesday that three investigating judges have been assigned to the case. This typically denotes a progression from the preliminary investigation.\\n\\nThe complaint from Benabderrahmane’s lawyers does not specify what the alleged documents are, but claims that “they were likely to be compromising for certain high-level people in Qatar, even foreigners.”\\n\\nAl-Khelaifi, who is a Qatari citizen, denies any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, his representative directed CNN to a statement which they said “Al-Khelaifi issued to L’Equipe in November, 2022.”\\n\\n“You are talking about professional criminals,” Al-Khelaifi said. “They’ve changed their lawyers more times than they’ve changed their stories and their lies.

       " \"A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it’s still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout, arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.\\n\\nFor the fans, it’s excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar, one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.\\n\\nFor the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. “Love hurts,” goes the anonymous quote, “but not as much as penalties.”\\n\\nSuccess or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates’ hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, “It’s as if, for a few seconds, a player’s soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.”\\n\\nArgentina supporters cheer during the World Cup final against France. Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nVery few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can’t get enough of them.\\n\\n“A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,” he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. “It’s painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!”\\n\\nProfessor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He’s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.\\n\\nHe’s studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they’re doing.\\n\\n“The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,” the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never “only a lottery.”\\n\\nAurelien Tchouameni misses France's third penalty in the World Cup final. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nPenalties are more important than ever\\n\\nThe margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it’s in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer’s biggest prizes are being decided.\\n\\n“If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,” says Jordet, “you’re making a severe mistake if you’re not prepared for penalties.”\\n\\nIn 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.\\n\\nMohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout. Backpage Media/Shutterstock\\n\\nThe following year was a bonanza for penalties.\\n\\nStarting in February with Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals – both against Chelsea – on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.\\n\\nEintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.\\n\\nThe 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.\\n\\nWithin seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He’s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.\\n\\n“The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,” Jordet explained to CNN Sport. “It seems like they don’t know what to do. And then with other teams, it’s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.”\\n\\nJurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals. Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images\\n\\nLast season’s FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.\\n\\nThey spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea’s seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.\\n\\n“He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he’s done with the plan,” Jordet observed in a tweet thread, “Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.\\n\\n“There’s plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.”\\n\\nLiverpool’s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.\\n\\nChelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.\\n\\nWorld Cup Final penalty masterclass\\n\\nNobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet’s research has confirmed that the goalies aren’t just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.\\n\\nIn recent seasons, Argentina’s 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the “Machiavelli of football.”\\n\\nJordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.\\n\\nSince the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, “I can tell you’re nervous. I know where you’re going to shoot. Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up. Remember, I’m going to eat you up!”\\n\\nBut it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.\\n\\nJordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. “Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,” Jordet explained.\\n\\n“He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,” a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.\\n\\nArgentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\\n\\nFor the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.\\n\\nThis kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?\\n\\nJordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to “fully get to work.”\\n\\nMartínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.\\n\\nJordet notes that goalkeepers don’t typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.\\n\\n“We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.\\n\\n“In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.”\\n\\nBy the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.\\n\\nThe approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.\\n\\nFrance fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final. Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\\n\\nWhen the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.\\n\\nTchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.\\n\\nBy now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.\\n\\nMartínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.\\n\\n“Very calculated, creative, well executed,” Jordet concludes, “but of course also highly, highly cynical.”\\n\\nEmiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nMartínez showed very little remorse for his “cynical” actions. After the final he said, “”I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.”\\n\\n“All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.”\\n\\nSince the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.\\n\\nThis would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.\\n\\nShootouts don’t always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.\\n\\nJordet notes that when LAFC’s Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.\\n\\n“You’re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you’re a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.”\\n\\nLos Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.\\n\\nThe power of intangibles\\n\\nSome teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.\\n\\nEngland has lost seven of the 10 that it’s participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain’s loss to Morocco in 2022 means it’s now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.\\n\\nJordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren’t involved in it, you’re more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.\\n\\nHaving lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty in the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.\\n\\nMore and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet’s consultancy business for help.\\n\\n“I totally think there’s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,” Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.\\n\\n“I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.”\\n\\nThe Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout. Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nJordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He’s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.\\n\\n“I love penalty shootouts,” he says, “I think it’s the ultimate drama in football.”\\n\\nAnd yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn’t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.\\n\\n“The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you’re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.\\n\\n“TV producers aren’t always my friends,” Jordet concludes, “because they don’t look at what I like to look at.”\\n\\nBut now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they’re missing the best bits.\",\n",
       " \"Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.\\n\\nExcept the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.\\n\\nThe two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.\\n\\nBut on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.\\n\\nBenn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.\\n\\nDespite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.\\n\\nIn a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.\\n\\nCancellation\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.\\n\\nBenn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.\\n\\n“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.\\n\\n“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.\\n\\n“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.\\n\\nBenn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”\\n\\nBenn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.\\n\\nHe criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.\\n\\n“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”\\n\\nThe BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”\\n\\nIt added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.”\\n\\nIt pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, “the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC’s rules (and those of UKAD).”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.\\n\\nBenn punches Chris Algieri during their WBA Continental welterweight title fight on December 11, 2021. Alex Livesey/Getty Images\\n\\n‘Serious concerns’\\n\\nThe WBC’s February ruling stated that they had found there to be “no failures in the procedures” in relation to Benn’s sample and test.\\n\\nBut Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but “without explanation” was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.\\n\\nAccording to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test – which the World Anti-Doping Agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible.\\n\\nBenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\\n\\nBenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October’s test, adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error.”\\n\\nWhile Benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career, the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing.\\n\\n“Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.”\\n\\nBenn admitted that he’d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: “I didn’t think I’d see another day.”\\n\\n“It’s hurt me,” Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. “I didn’t think I was going to make it through this period. I didn’t think I was going to make it through.”\\n\\nWhen asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so – and it upsets me now because I don’t know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.\\n\\n“I was shamed for something I hadn’t even done. … If I had done something wrong, I’m human. I’d raise my hands to it, ‘I made a mistake,’ whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.\\n\\n“I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else’s incompetence.

Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nFlores says she trained for years as many women interested in boxing do in Cuba: on her own dime and in gyms lacking in even the most basic equipment.\\n\\nWhile they could learn and practice the sport as a hobby, the ban on women’s boxing meant Cuban female athletes could not take part in tournaments on the island or abroad.\\n\\nAt least officially, women’s boxing in Cuba did not exist.\\n\\nA new dawn\\n\\nIn December, the first cracks in that glass ceiling appeared when officials made an about face after announcing that they had obtained the proper safety equipment for them – such as padding and head gear.\\n\\n“We took this step when we were sure, really convinced that it was the moment and we didn’t have any concerns because our women would be protected,” Cuban Boxing Commission President Alberto Puig de la Barca told reporters at a news conference.\\n\\nThe change, sports officials said at the news conference, was also the result of a newly implemented family code on the island that said women were required by law to have the same opportunities as men. That apparently included boxing.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the first try outs were held at a cramped facility with a single boxing ring. Many of the women boxers had only recently switched from competing in martial arts or had merely dabbled in boxing.\\n\\nStill, they sparred with passion, drawing appreciative cheering and applause from spectators.\\n\\nAfter the first bout, an announcer exclaimed to the crowd of people watching, “This is historic!”\\n\\nCuban boxer Namibia Flores has fought for years for women's boxing to be recognized in Cuba.

       " 'For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.\\n\\nOr at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.\\n\\nThe matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it’s a ratio he is more than content with.\\n\\n“Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It’s the pinnacle of our sport, it’s what you’re judged by,” Koepka told CNN.\\n\\n“If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can’t tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person’s won or that person’s won, but they know exactly how many majors you’ve won.\\n\\n“So, to me, that’s what you’re defined by.”\\n\\n‘I love it when athletes get cocky’\\n\\nThey are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.\\n\\nKoepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It’s a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.\\n\\n“I’m pretty blunt, I don’t like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I’ve always been that way,” he said. “I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that’s how I feel.\\n\\n“I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves – I think that’s important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you’re doing.\\n\\n“If you feel you’re the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.”\\n\\nKoepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019. Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images\\n\\nAnd Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.\\n\\nOnly five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.\\n\\nKoepka’s current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 – albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.\\n\\nInjury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had “dislocated and shattered” his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.\\n\\nHis struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix’s new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series “Full Swing,” where Koepka admitted his slump was “the worst” he had ever suffered in his life.\\n\\n“There was a lot of stuff … just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,” Koepka told CNN.\\n\\n“The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you’re just sitting there. There’s a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you’ve just got to endure, just to make it better. It’s not always fun, not always glamorous.”\\n\\nKoepka struggled for form during 2022. Soobum Im/USA Today Network/Reuters\\n\\nHealth is wealth\\n\\nYet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.\\n\\nAlongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner’s earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.\\n\\nBrooks and Chase Koepka toast their victory at the LIV Golf Invitiational - Jeddah. Charles Laberge/LIV Golf/Getty Images\\n\\n“To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable … something I can really, really look back on,” Koepka said.\\n\\n“I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year – I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.\\n\\n“Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that’s the goal.”\\n\\nNaturally though, that isn’t Koepka’s only goal for 2023. A self-confessed “slow starter,” he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.\\n\\nRunner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a “good” 2023.\\n\\n“Hopefully a few wins, and then a major – that’s the goal every year,” he said.',\n",

       " 'More than a year after US Soccer and the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) brokered a landmark equal pay agreement, USWNT star player and two-time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe is still coming to terms with the implications of what her team has achieved.\\n\\nFollowing years of lawsuits and lobbying from players, the Federation last year agreed to a new 50-50 split in the way it pays men and women competing for the US national soccer teams, meaning both sides will receive the same pay and prize money, including for participating at World Cups.\\n\\n“There was a relentlessness, and a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved,” Rapinoe told WBD sports analyst Julie Foudy, adding she’s proud of “the group effort that it took.”\\n\\n“It was almost like we couldn’t lose, I said that a lot. If the Federation won, everybody loses and if we win, everybody wins,” the two-time World Cup champion added.\\n\\nRapinoe said the team worked together and saw setbacks, not as losses, but as “just a step on the journey. Ultimately, I think that gave us a lot of confidence on the field as well – we were all in it together, we were all doing our part.”\\n\\nThe USWNT fought for the agreement for years, through lawsuits and lobbying. Sam Hodde/Getty Images\\n\\n“There’s something about feeling desperate that is really powerful, and I think, at times, we were,” she added, saying the team felt an immense pressure to win the Women’s World Cup in 2019 while battling to prove their worth off the field – they did, defending their 2015 title, beating The Netherlands in the final thanks to goals from Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle.\\n\\n“We obviously want[ed] to win, professionally, as your sport, but there was some understanding of desperation there. We have this opportunity to grasp this moment, and I think [with] the combination of personalities, we knew that and we rose to that occasion,” she said.\\n\\nThe agreement has already changed the way remuneration works in US Soccer: the USWNT earned more money from its male equivalent reaching the knockout stages of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar than it did from winning its own tournaments in 2015 and 2019.\\n\\nIt also means the USMNT will pick up half of the USWNT’s prize money in the future.\\n\\nRipple effect\\n\\nRapinoe reflected that when fighting for equal pay, the women’s team had a unique opportunity to make change as a collective, which in turn inspired women around the world who were having to push for changes on their own.\\n\\n“What we’re most proud of is that it’s been something that people can see themselves in and gain confidence from,” she said.\\n\\n“We’re in a really unique and special situation to be around a bunch of other elite women: that almost never happens,” she explained.\\n\\nThe agreement, Rapinoe reflected, came as part of \"a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved.\" Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n“If you’re the best at what you do, normally you’re one of one, or one of a few if you’re in a company, or if you’re in a C-suite position, most likely, you’re one of one or one of two. It’s not very often that you have 20-something women that are able to do that, so I think that women put themselves in there with us.”\\n\\nRapinoe said she has heard stories of women who asked for a raise based on the team’s success.\\n\\n“It’s almost like they’re… getting that imagery of all of us standing behind them and having that confidence.\\n\\n“We kind of realized early on that this was such a bigger movement that we were a part of. Yes, we’re one of the sort of ‘out front’ main players, even just in the soccer world or in the women’s sports world in general, we were a part of something so much bigger.\\n\\n“I think other women who don’t necessarily have the ability to have a bunch of other women around them saw themselves in us and were able to use that as motivation and be on our team,” she said.',\n",

This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That’s not going to be taken away.\\n\\n“It’s just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that’s a good thing. Like I’m not saying that we’re going to have field sizes of 50, it’s going to be closer to what you’ve seen in the past.

Studies have found that repetitive hits to the head – even without concussion – can result in CTE.\\n\\nThe disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of symptoms including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.\\n\\nCross’s widow described the struggle he faced.\\n\\n“For the last five years of his life Irv stopped being able to do the things he loved and his problems with his balance, memory, and delusions, were very embarrassing and depressing for him,” Liz Cross said in a statement. “His life became a constant struggle, and he suspected it was from CTE. Now that we know for sure, Irv would want others to learn about the disease and the risks of playing tackle football, especially for children.”\\n\\nCross, a two-time Pro Bowl cornerback who was drafted in 1961, played nine seasons in the NFL – six for the Philadelphia Eagles and three for the Los Angeles Rams.\\n\\nHe would return to Philadelphia in 1969, becoming a player and coach. After retiring in 1970, he became an Eagles assistant coach.\\n\\nIn his nine seasons, Cross had 22 interceptions, 14 fumble recoveries and two defensive touchdowns.\\n\\nAfter his NFL career, Cross became the first African American sports analyst on national television when he worked for CBS Sports as an NFL analyst and commentator from 1971 to 1994.\\n\\nHe anchored the Emmy-winning show “The NFL Today,” from its inception in 1975 through 1989.

It was the whole team; you saw 11 individuals losing their heads,” Ten Hag told reporters after the game.\\n\\n“That is unprofessional, that is not Manchester United. We have other standards, these were not the standards we want to show.\\n\\n“Every defeat, no matter what, is worse, especially when you lose at Liverpool. We let the fans down so that is the most annoying.”\\n\\nDespite finding itself 1-0 down at the break, United had initially coped well with the Anfield atmosphere and was very much in the game as the second half kicked off.\\n\\nShortly after the restart though, Liverpool began pulling away and United’s players seemed to give up as the host went for the jugular.\\n\\nBraces from Cody Gakpo, Darwin Núñez and Mo Salah, plus Roberto Firmino’s late goal, secured the utterly dominant win and it’s no surprise that many of United’s traveling fans had left the stadium before the final whistle.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some of United’s senior players lost discipline and failed to track Liverpool’s unrelenting forward runs on multiple occasions.\\n\\n“For the [fans] who stayed, it was tough, and we really have to thank them,” ten Hag added.\\n\\n“I can’t blame those who go away because it was a really bad performance.

Then it was really difficult to play against us.”\\n\\nKlopp also saved special praise for Salah who became Liverpool’s top Premier League scorer with his second effort.\\n\\n“[He] achieved something really, really special – we should not forget that just because we are used to him scoring a lot of goals,” Klopp added.\\n\\n“Very special, very special player, very special boy and [he] should be really proud of that.”\\n\\nJurgen Klopp was all smiles while celebrating Liverpool's memorable win. Jon Super/AP\\n\\nNow on 129 league goals, Salah overtakes legendary striker Robbie Fowler having played 61 fewer games.\\n\\nSalah himself admitted the record was very special to him but said he wouldn’t get carried away with the achievement.\\n\\n“It’s very special, I can’t lie,” he told reporters. “This record was in my mind since I came here.\\n\\n“I think after my first season I was always chasing that record. To beat it today against United with that result is unbelievable.\\n\\n“I’m going home to celebrate with the family, have a camomile tea and sleep.”\\n\\nDespite the result, United still sits seven points ahead of Liverpool in the league, but the latter moves just three points behind Tottenham in the fourth and final Champions League place with a game in hand.\\n\\nTen Hag will be hoping his side is resilient enough to shake off the disappointment as it faces Real Betis in the Europa League on Thursday.\",\n",

Someone that’s got to get better and needs some help. And then also there’s accountability to the team that we got to stand for.\\n\\n“Obviously, nationwide – league-wide – there’s a lot of attention on gun violence. For us internally on this matter, that’s the stance we’ve taken on this about how we can support Ja throughout this growth opportunity. It’s a learning opportunity. Hopefully, we can be better from it.”\\n\\nJenkins reiterated the team will continue to support Morant through the process.\\n\\n“We love him. We want what’s best for him. We support him. It’s going to be a difficult process, but we got a great group to get through this,” Jenkins added.\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Morant, who participated in his second All-Star game last month, is averaging 27.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game this season.\\n\\nFollowing tonight’s game, Memphis is scheduled to play the Lakers in Los Angeles on Tuesday before returning home to host the Golden State Warriors on Thursday.']"

saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup The 38yearold was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win\\n\\nJust as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a threegame winning streak with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines\\n\\nMultiple reports say the 19time AllStar could miss several weeks but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury\\n\\nJames posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies along with the caption “Fkn sucks”\\n\\nJust another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time\\n\\nWith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s playin tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season\\n\\nDennis Schröder of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots over Jonas Valančiūnas of the New Orleans Pelicans Kevork DjansezianGetty Images\\n\\nSteadily improving\\n\\nFor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers\\n\\nHeading into the season general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook\\n\\nThe acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title\\n\\nCriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player\\n\\nSo the season began as many predicted with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games On November 12 the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference\\n\\nTo the credit of firstyear head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole winning eight of their next 10 games\\n\\nBut down to a combination of injuries lack of consistency and a lopsided roster the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle\\n\\nMidseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley D’Angelo Russell Jarred Vanderbilt Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving while Westbrook was finally shipped out\\n\\nAfter Sunday’s win over the Mavericks Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our as”\\n\\nSince the two trades on February 9 the team has gone 42 and seemingly turned its season on its head\\n\\nJames shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends Maddie MeyerGetty Images\\n\\nWhat are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs\\n\\nIn any NBA season until 2020 the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying\\n\\nBut following the introduction of the playin tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid19 pandemic a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp\\n\\nThe playin tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth with the winner earning the No 7 seed in the playoffs\\n\\nThe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket\\n\\nIt means that at the time of writing the Lakers are currently on a threegame winning streak have a record of 2932 and sit 12th in the Western Conference a game outside the playin tournament They are only twoandahalf games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs\\n\\nAccording to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left\\n\\nIt has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the AllStar break\\n\\nTied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers we could well be seeing the 17time NBA champion duking it out in the playin – James’ injury permitting\\n\\nWho knows in a congested Western Conference the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the oldfashioned method',\n",

that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled\\n\\n“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man” Paterson tells CNN Sport\\n\\n“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think ‘Oh my God … where did this come from’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it”\\n\\nThe scene first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands proved prescient Last year Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\\n\\n“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change” says Paterson\\n\\nFelix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in All Quiet on the Western Front Reiner BajoNetflix\\n\\nFirst portrayed on screen in a muchloved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure\\n\\nPaterson alongside writing partner Ian Stokell got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a Germanlanguage film\\n\\nThe end product which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail\\n\\nIt has been met with great critical acclaim receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a recordequaling 14 BAFTA nominations\\n\\nThe BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that for Paterson will cap off years of hard work stress and dogged resolve\\n\\nA fivetime world champion across two formats of offroad triathlon she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain\\n\\nThat was in 2016 when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain she started to search for a solution\\n\\nWith the help of her husband and her physio she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars leaving only the milelong sea swim to consider\\n\\n“I do a lot of onearm drills” says Paterson “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick I practiced in the ocean and I was like ‘Well I can do one arm let’s give this a shot’”\\n\\nAfter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field Paterson made up ground on the 40kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10kilometer run\\n\\n“I just kind of kept on going” she says “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box I had to get something done”\\n\\nTriathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham Alabama in 2012 Kevin C CoxGetty Images\\n\\nThe experience itself worthy of a film script was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life\\n\\n“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes” she says “I’m a very sort of passionate heartdriven athlete”\\n\\nPaterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA crosstriathlon series – “all offroad and muddy and gritty and out in nature” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career\\n\\nAfter she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground\\n\\n“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money” says Paterson\\n\\n“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well It was a massive motivation”\\n\\nOver the years Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines driven she says by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail\\n\\n“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions the artist in me and the athlete in me” says Paterson\\n\\n“People think they are often very separate but they’re actually very very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete”\\n\\nAll Quiet on the Western Front was released last year and has been highly acclaimed Reiner BajoNetflix\\n\\nWhether it’s sports or scriptwriting Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in”\\n\\nIt perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry\\n\\nThe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago\\n\\nAnd with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German rather than English\\n\\n“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story it’s their national novel it’s rightly so that it’s in German” says Paterson\\n\\nThe popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future\\n\\nWhatever she does next Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy\\n\\n“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me” she says\\n\\n“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes”',\n",

       " 'Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar who asked “Et tu Brute” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic\\n\\nFast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League ESL that would have turned the sport on its head effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot\\n\\nDriven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year\\n\\nIn the Apple TV documentary “Super League The War for Football” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days” its Emmyaward winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports\\n\\nFeaturing almost all the key decision makers the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and most stingingly of all “betrayal” between friends\\n\\nThe friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary\\n\\nInitially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army” Zimbalist says\\n\\n“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day” he adds “The complexity of who to trust And how deep the wound of betrayal runs”\\n\\nAleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016 Apple TV\\n\\nCharacters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions delving into their backstories\\n\\nČeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers Agnelli about his brother’s death Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club and Paris SaintGermain President Nasser AlKhelaifi’s about his tennis playing days\\n\\n“This is not a bunch of robotic mechanical strategists sitting around a war room” Zimbalist says “These are human beings flesh and blood with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time\\n\\n“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other”\\n\\n‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia’\\n\\nBut the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships beyond even soccer as the project entangled Russian oligarchs American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved\\n\\nEven Prince William intervened expressing his opposition to the idea while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming\\n\\nPublic opinion became another battleground with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public\\n\\nAndrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser AlKhelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association Apple TV\\n\\nThe documentary is balanced offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion\\n\\n“That was how we presented it to them” Zimbalist says\\n\\n“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they for 15 minutes at a time are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments”\\n\\nBut Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups\\n\\n“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs the architects of the Super League” he says “But then you’re leaving out in some ways the most important voice which is the fan voice”\\n\\nThe entire documentary opens with the fans lingering on the emotion provoked by football and detailing the sport’s most fairytalelike stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016\\n\\nSo much of football’s magic almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined\\n\\nReal Madrid won the 2022 Champions League Mustafa YalcinAnadolu AgencyGetty Images\\n\\nIt epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs owned by megarich owners and able to simply buy the best players\\n\\n“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia” Zimbalist says “If you look at the Super League story capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious”\\n\\nEuropean governing body UEFA too emerged victorious vowing to stop the “cynical project” as seemingly did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions\\n\\nThe documentary however details FIFA’s more ambiguous position its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league the documentary says\\n\\n‘The war for football rages on’\\n\\nStill the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month\\n\\nZimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City\\n\\n“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a 40 billion a year industry” he says\\n\\n“And ask big questions about can culture be owned And how do you govern culture”\\n\\nGiorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA Apple TV\\n\\nFor Barcelona and Juventus their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years\\n\\nJuventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turinbased team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020 while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin\\n\\nBarcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025”\\n\\nBut Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them “the Super League is in the past”\\n\\n“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward it’s not something that we’re interested in”\\n\\nMeanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on\\n\\nAn opinion issued by the European Court of Justice ECJ ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL\\n\\nThe ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year\\n\\nThe ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League the vision that it proposes are likely to take other forms and to evolve” Zimbalist says\\n\\n“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over But the war for football rages on”',\n",

Association IBA on Monday of possible “sabotage” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games\\n\\nIt comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee IOC as well as several boxing federations around the world which has led to eight countries including the US boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world

sanctioned by the IOC into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance governance ethics and refereeing and judging”\\n\\nSerbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs 31 million by the end of June 2021\\n\\nAt the time IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future”\\n\\nThe IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations In a statement the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing”\\n\\nAs a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games An IOC task force ran

the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes”\\n\\nAbout a month later the US and more than 30 other “likeminded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision and

statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes”\\n\\nOn Wednesday the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible”\\n\\nThe IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to

the family that I have currently anymore I came really close to losing everything that I cared about\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me obviously there was some decisions that I made but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the

unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol\\n\\nKirk who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family added he had given up beer in late 2017 switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues\\n\\nFor Kirk his openness had simply been about personal catharsis Subsequently the response from others has blown him away\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory Douglas P DeFeliceGetty Images\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time to quit” Kirk said\\n\\n“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it that was not in my mind at all It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself lying to my family hiding a lot of things\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide and so it was just the natural thing for me to do\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit it’s

event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title\\n\\nFor both players it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff and for Kirk it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him

the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole Kirk tapped home for birdie and

       " 'It had been 2836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind\\n\\nA nailbiting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago\\n\\n“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort\\n\\n“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore I came really close to losing everything that I cared about\\n\\n“For that to have happened and worked out for me obviously there was some decisions that I made but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way\\n\\n“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that”\\n\\nKirk during the final round Douglas P DeFeliceGetty Images\\n\\n‘I got sober because of you’\\n\\nOn the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019 Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression\\n\\n“I thought I could control it but after multiple relapses I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own” Kirk added in a social media post\\n\\nBy that point his world ranking which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015 had plummeted to 188th He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 201819 PGA Tour season\\n\\nA tied15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top40 finish of the campaign\\n\\nWhen he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019 his rank had fallen even further – he was world No 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man\\n\\nA candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol\\n\\nKirk who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family added he had given up beer in late 2017 switching to win and hard liquor such as wine vodka and bourbon That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues\\n\\nFor Kirk his openness had simply been about personal catharsis Subsequently the response from others has blown him away\\n\\nKirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory Douglas P DeFeliceGetty Images\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time to quit” Kirk said\\n\\n“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it that was not in my mind at all It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself lying to my family hiding a lot of things\\n\\n“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide and so it was just the natural thing for me to do\\n\\n“But now on the back end a little bit it’s been amazing Like I said it’s not something that I really saw happening but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say ‘I got sober because of you and my life has changed because of you’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words”\\n\\nAugusta calling\\n\\nOn Sunday disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole\\n\\nThe American recovered well but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole his 34yearold compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title\\n\\nFor both players it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff and for Kirk it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier\\n\\nAgain Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree However an incredible response saw the 37yearold spark a 267yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand\\n\\nWhen Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory\\n\\nAs well as securing him 1512000 in prize money Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings Just as sweetly it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta\\n\\n“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely trying to stay in the top 50 but to take care of it this week that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special” Kirk said\\n\\n“That par3 contest can’t come soon enough I’m really looking forward to that The whole week but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome”\\n\\nOn Thursday Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family\\n\\n“It’ll be a lot of celebrating and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it” Kirk said',\n",
       " 'For four days this week home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitchblack room There were no phones no television no lights or distractions Just Rodgers alone with his thoughts in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark\\n\\nWhen the fourtime NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a “darkness retreat” many were left scratching their heads\\n\\n“It’s just sitting in isolation meditation dealing with your thoughts” Rodgers said earlier this month “We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness I’m really looking forward to it”\\n\\nRodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of selflove The football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life”\\n\\nBut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat And is it just another newage fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us\\n\\nWhat happens in the dark\\n\\nA darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats nestled in the CascadeSiskiyou wilderness in Southern Oregon near Klamath Falls\\n\\nThe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\n“The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more to people who want to rest reset and relax to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice” said Scott Berman who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives\\n\\n“When someone goes into the darkness all these things that were important to them like money fame power status being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark” Berman said “In the dark all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love forgiveness peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you”\\n\\nThe center currently operates three standalone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earthsheltered caves which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home Each space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation Participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident\\n\\nThe cost includes three meals a day which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening through a lightproof doublesided food box to minimize the disturbance This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes according to Berman depending on the person’s needs\\n\\nParticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of 250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience\\n\\nEach space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation Sky Cave Retreats\\n\\nBurak Dalcik a 27yearold salesman from Arlington Virginia said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative but rather allowed them to come and to go which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life He also said he started calling his mom who lives back in Turkey more frequently\\n\\n“It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are” said Dalcik “There’s nothing New Age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself And if you can’t you should probably get pretty curious about why”\\n\\nBerman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles\\n\\n“It’s not like this magical mindblowing amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable” Berman said “But in the darkness discomfort is the door to transformation There’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves”\\n\\nA therapeutic tool or junk science\\n\\nFor now there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain\\n\\n“That’s totally false” said Dr David Blask the head of the Laboratory of ChronoNeuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine “There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint”\\n\\nDr Marek Malůš a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010 sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool\\n\\n“Your thoughts memories emotions inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated” Malůš said\\n\\nWhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and selfesteem lower symptoms of depression and anxiety while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience\\n\\nBerman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high\\n\\n“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a socalled DMT experience you’ve come into the wrong place” he said “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature”\\n\\nFor those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits Berman suggests starting small at home\\n\\n“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down putting the phone away turning out the lights closing the blinds and just resting” he said “Not to get somewhere not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself”',\n",

pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings\\n\\nThe new schedule offers increased prize purses smaller fields and no cuts much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series\\n\\n“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays” world No 8 Max Homa told reporters\\n\\n“Which you look back at times of Phil and Tiger the two best players growing up for me watching and they had like maybe two real battles So we’re going to have more of that”\\n\\nWorld No 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs the hot guys”\\n\\nUnveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players\\n\\nEligibility criteria as well as which events are to be marked as “designated” are set to be specified at a later date a press release from the Tour said\\n\\nHowever it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings the top30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings and tournament winners during the season\\n\\nAnd with no 36hole cut line all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses as well as FedEx Cup points\\n\\nThough involvement will not be mandatory these two factors as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments will “incentivize” participation the Tour added\\n\\n“These smaller Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial can’tmiss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season but they will also enhance the quality of FullField events” Monahan said in the letter to players\\n\\n“Together this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive compelling consequential and with clarity for fans players and sponsors alike”\\n\\nThe new scheduling will not affect the majors The Players Championship as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events Their existing format is set to remain unchanged with designated events run in addition\\n\\n‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’\\n\\nDesignated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August with 12 on the 2023 schedule The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February as Scottie Scheffler secured 36 million in prize money\\n\\nThough still including a cut line the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudibacked LIV Golf Series last year\\n\\nBankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund PIF LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series\\n\\nPIF pledged to award 250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season Of the 25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events 20 million was a guaranteed split between players Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four golfers could not be cut as part of a teambased format\\n\\n“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery Congratulations PGA Tour Welcome to the future” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday\\n\\nThe inaugural LIV Golf

were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule\\n\\nConsistently outspoken against LIV Golf accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf McIlroy has previously been dubbed the defacto spokesperson for the PGA Tour\\n\\nAsked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lowerranked golfers “on the outside looking in” the fourtime major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans\\n\\n“I love it” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions I think it makes the TOUR more competitive\\n\\n“I’m all about rewarding good play I want to give everyone a fair shake at this Which I think this structure has done There’s ways to play into it\\n\\nWhen Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop” the world No 2 said “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often\\n\\n“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors\\n\\n“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events\\n\\n“If you earn your way in to those events the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour”\\n\\nMcIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday Richard HeathcoteGetty Images\\n\\nScheffler Money not a factor\\n\\nDiscussing the increased spotlight on prize purses Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour\\n\\n“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys” Scheffler said\\n\\n“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money you just want to win the tournament\\n\\n“So as being kind of a golf purist that’s the motivation I want to be able to play well win tournaments and get the most out of my game”\\n\\nIn response to the absence of a cut line at designated events McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format\\n\\n“The only reason nocut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been nocut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well” McIlroy said\\n\\n“It keeps the stars there for four days You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event they want to see the stars at the weekend They want a guarantee that the stars are there So if that’s what needs to happen then that’s what happens”\\n\\nHoma’s ‘rant’\\n\\nPerhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however came from Homa who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32yearold American delivered a four fourminute monologue\\n\\nWhile he understood “gripes” around the limited fields Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game\\n\\n“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans” said Homa\\n\\nAddressing concerns over restricted fields Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event According to Homa the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro\\n\\n“Those people will be in a ton of the events” he said\\n\\nHoma in action during the proam prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational Michael ReavesGetty Images\\n\\n“Now the sponsors have to say ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field being guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that” added Homa\\n\\n“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week\\n\\n“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week If you don’t you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up\\n\\n“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before but I do think it will be stressful”\\n\\nAsked if he wanted a

more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers\\n\\n“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams mechanics media all of us” he said “But we love what we do We have a dream job We enjoy every second of it”\\n\\nAlonso unquestionably loves what he does Last season he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon\\n\\nHe is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment” but if the preseason omens are anything to go by that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy\\n\\nTwo decades on from his first race win Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again',\n",

the Netherlands through her fingers By the end she looked distraught All the emotion had been wrung out of her and the tears that she cried were of relief rather than joy\\n\\nFor the players such emotions are magnified tenfold “Love hurts” goes the anonymous quote “but not as much as penalties”\\n\\nSuccess or failure could be careerdefining one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates’ hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans As the author Karl Wiggins put it “It’s as if for a few seconds a player’s soul is laid bare for the entire world to see”\\n\\nArgentina supporters cheer during the World Cup final against France Paul EllisAFPGetty Images\\n\\nVery few people would admit to enjoying a shootout but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception he can’t get enough of them\\n\\n“A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event” he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo “It’s painful because the pressure is so intense and of course the consequences of failing are so dire Penalties for me are wonderful”\\n\\nProfessor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure He’s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them around 2000 kicks in total\\n\\nHe’s studied the psychology of the event observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they’re doing\\n\\n“The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck” the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared but Jordet is convinced that it is never “only a lottery”\\n\\nAurelien Tchouameni misses Frances third penalty in the World Cup final Julian FinneyGetty Images\\n\\nPenalties are more important than ever\\n\\nThe margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer and so it’s in shootouts where the margins are even tighter that soccer’s biggest prizes are being decided\\n\\n“If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win” says Jordet “you’re making a severe mistake if you’re not prepared for penalties”\\n\\nIn 2021 both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo in the same month Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley\\n\\nMohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout Backpage MediaShutterstock\\n\\nThe following year was a bonanza for penalties\\n\\nStarting in February with Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt Liverpool won two English cup finals – both against Chelsea – on spotkicks while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot\\n\\nEintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final\\n\\nThe 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts including the final\\n\\nWithin seconds of the final whistle being blown Jordet can tell if one side has the edge He’s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field\\n\\n“The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties” Jordet explained to CNN Sport “It seems like they don’t know what to do And then with other teams it’s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties”\\n\\nJurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals Michael ReganThe FAGetty Images\\n\\nLast season’s FA Cup final was a case in point Jordet observed that Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle\\n\\nThey spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea’s seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players and he was still revising his notes\\n\\n“He moves to the middle of the circle BEFORE he’s done with the plan” Jordet observed in a tweet thread “Tuchel then asks his players about the shots publicly in front of the whole team\\n\\n“There’s plenty of group pressure when done this way the chance of honest responses from the players drops and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself”\\n\\nLiverpool’s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love\\n\\nChelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy\\n\\nWorld Cup Final penalty masterclass\\n\\nNobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper who is involved in every single kick Jordet’s research has confirmed that the goalies aren’t just there to stop the shots they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents\\n\\nIn recent seasons Argentina’s 30yearold goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts the “Machiavelli of football”\\n\\nJordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021 he intimidated his opponents with trash talk saving three penalties in a 32 win\\n\\nSince the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying “I can tell you’re nervous I know where you’re going to shoot Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up Remember I’m going to eat you up”\\n\\nBut it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise\\n\\nJordet says that he set the tone right from the start arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own “Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything” Jordet explained\\n\\n“He created his home in the penalty area He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive” a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes\\n\\nArgentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers Simon StacpooleOffsideGetty Images\\n\\nFor the first two French penalties Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot\\n\\nThis kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers but he was also feeling out the referee how much would he be prepared to tolerate\\n\\nJordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to “fully get to work”\\n\\nMartínez saved the second penalty that he faced diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman and his celebration was exuberant\\n\\nJordet notes that goalkeepers don’t typically celebrate so wildly but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events\\n\\n“We found to our astonishment that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team\\n\\n“In fact the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 1015 of the time and your next teammate scores about 7 to 8 more of their penalties These types of celebratory displays are contagious”\\n\\nBy the time the third French player stepped up Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything He snatched up the ball turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line\\n\\nThe approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot instead Martínez was holding it gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume\\n\\nFrance fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final Catherine IvillGetty Images\\n\\nWhen the referee demanded its return Martínez rolled it away at a 45degree angle forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30\\n\\nTchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed\\n\\nBy now Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes one of four Argentine penalty takers who all scored\\n\\nMartínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player Randal Kolo Muani but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 42\\n\\n“Very calculated creative well executed” Jordet concludes “but of course also highly highly cynical”\\n\\nEmiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty Julian FinneyGetty Images\\n\\nMartínez showed very little remorse for his “cynical” actions After the final he said “”I have no words for it I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted”\\n\\n“All that I have dreamed of has been achieved”\\n\\nSince the conclusion of the World Cup the International Football Association Board IFAB which determines the laws of football confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken\\n\\nThis would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts crossbar or goal net\\n\\nShootouts don’t always have to be so negative though sometimes they can be won with love\\n\\nJordet notes that when LAFC’s Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in\\n\\n“You’re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss you’re a part of the group which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout”\\n\\nLos Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup\\n\\nThe power of intangibles\\n\\nSome teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout while others dread it\\n\\nEngland has lost seven of the 10 that it’s participated in while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight Spain’s loss to Morocco in 2022 means it’s now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone\\n\\nJordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout even if you weren’t involved in it you’re more likely to miss Conversely success begets success\\n\\nHaving lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty in the European Championship final in 1976 Germany has won six in a row Croatia has won its last four and Argentina its last three claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup\\n\\nMore and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet’s consultancy business for help\\n\\n“I totally think there’s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science” Jordet says dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development relationships and psychology are important but not quantifiable\\n\\n“I honestly would beg to differ If you know what to look for you can measure a lot of these things in games and this is something I work on every single day I think we will make some big progress in the years to come”\\n\\nThe Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout Julian FinneyGetty Images\\n\\nJordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives watching every single shootout from the World Cup European Championship and Copa América since 1976 He’s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams\\n\\n“I love penalty shootouts” he says “I think it’s the ultimate drama in football”\\n\\nAnd yet much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn’t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans\\n\\n“The details that really mattered the subplot of the event can only be accessed if you’re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube\\n\\n“TV producers aren’t always my friends” Jordet concludes “because they don’t look at what I like to look at”\\n\\nBut now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses and sometimes they’re missing the best bits',\n",
       " 'Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr last year was meant to be career defining for both men\\n\\nExcept the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols\\n\\nThe two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans Benn and Eubank Jr were fighting for more than just glory This was a fight for family honor\\n\\nBut on the eve of the bout news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate\\n\\nBenn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023 the World Boxing Council WBC issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances his “highlyelevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test\\n\\nDespite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport the 26yearold Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control BBBofC the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain\\n\\nIn a statement posted on his Instagram story last week Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment\\n\\nCancellation\\n\\nAccording to the US AntiDoping Agency USADA clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis” The drug is also included on the World AntiDoping Agency’s prohibited list under antiestrogenic substances\\n\\nBenn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation\\n\\n“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that” he wrote\\n\\n“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs” Benn wrote referring to the Voluntary AntiDoping Association VADA a thirdparty testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test\\n\\n“As part of its lengthy investigation the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause” he wrote saying he provided a 270page report to the body\\n\\nBenn added “However I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent”\\n\\nBenn is still under investigation from UK AntiDoping UKAD and the BBCofC at the time of publication\\n\\nHe criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement\\n\\n“As for the BBBoC they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state”\\n\\nThe BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr Benn’s behalf”\\n\\nIt added that while “it respects the WBC the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr Benn was licensed at the material time and as such any alleged antidoping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations”\\n\\nIt pointed to the UK AntiDoping Rules brought in by UKAD which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result “the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC’s rules and those of UKAD”\\n\\nCNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity\\n\\nBenn punches Chris Algieri during their WBA Continental welterweight title fight on December 11 2021 Alex LiveseyGetty Images\\n\\n‘Serious concerns’\\n\\nThe WBC’s February ruling stated that they had found there to be “no failures in the procedures” in relation to Benn’s sample and test\\n\\nBut Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation claiming that his sample tested negative three times but “without explanation” was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test\\n\\nAccording to Benn he asked for his B sample from the drug test – which the World AntiDoping Agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible\\n\\nBenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport\\n\\nBenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October’s test adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error”\\n\\nWhile Benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing\\n\\n“Antidoping protections are obviously extremely important but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty Cheaters should be caught and punished but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career”\\n\\nBenn admitted that he’d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process saying “I didn’t think I’d see another day”\\n\\n“It’s hurt me” Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV “I didn’t think I was going to make it through this period I didn’t think I was going to make it through”\\n\\nWhen asked if he had felt suicidal Benn replied “Yeah Yeah I’d say so – and it upsets me now because I don’t know how I got so bad I got in a really bad way about it\\n\\n“I was shamed for something I hadn’t even done … If I had done something wrong I’m human I’d raise my hands to it ‘I made a mistake’ whatever it is I raise my hands Never this\\n\\n“I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice and leaving my family and the image I maintain was just ruined by somebody else’s incompetence It’s been hard for the family”\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAt the time of Benn’s positive test last year the bout’s promoter Matchroom and that organization’s boss Eddie Hearn had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being “prohibited” by the BBBofC\\n\\nHearn told the BBC at the time “As we stand right now the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight That does not mean the fight is off but there is a process we have to go through\\n\\n“Conor Benn is not suspended he is free and clear to fight There’s lots going on with the lawyers”\\n\\nEddie Hearn boxing promoter of Matchroom boxing speaks at the press conference ahead of Benns scheduled fight with Eubank Jr Alex BroadwayGetty Images\\n\\nAmid mounting public pressure and safety concerns the fight was canceled\\n\\nThe decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight’s moneymaking opportunities rather than the boxers’ safety\\n\\nWeeks later the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld\\n\\nBenn accused the BBBofC of conducting an “unfair and biased procedure” He also disputes that he relinquished his license\\n\\n“Benn strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion” a statement said on Benn’s Twitter at the time\\n\\nAnd a few months later the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not “engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene”',\n",

four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same\\n\\nThe matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between

event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020\\n\\nThere were a couple of cameos in December – a fatherson outing at the PNC Championship and a friendly battle at TNT’s The Match – but even in those he looked to be visibly struggling with movement at various points\\n\\nHis position on playing a limited schedule picking and choosing a select number of tournaments remains the same with Woods earmarking The Masters at Augusta as a potential target While he revealed his leg has improved Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging\\n\\n“I can still hit shots but it’s the walking endurance that’s hard” he said\\n\\n“That’s something that we’ve had to work on walking distances on the beach just basically stress it out but also be able to

optimistic about its development\\n\\n“From a marketing side of it and from the Tour side of it and the future of our sport it’s been very positive” Woods said\\n\\n“We need to keep going with it and need to stay aligned and keep progressing and making it better We need to produce the best product we possibly can to sell to all the viewerships\\n\\n“It’s about us creating the best products so we

the membership being really happy that they’re in them and… but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they’re always going to be on the outside looking in” McIroy told reporters\\n\\n“I think that the big thing has been ‘Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week’ And it’s not This tour was built on meritocracy This tour was built on if you shoot the scores you can move up the levels and play the biggest events That’s not going to be taken away\\n\\n“It’s just about making it more competitive Ultimately I think that’s a good thing Like I’m not saying that we’re going to have field sizes of 50 it’s going to be closer to what you’ve seen in the past We’re not trying to limit opportunities out here but we also want to make sure

momentum with a threegame winning streak with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part james looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines\\n\\nmultiple reports say the 19time allstar could miss several weeks but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury\\n\\njames posted a photo of his injured foot to his instagram story on monday after it was announced he would miss the match against the memphis grizzlies along with the caption “fkn sucks”\\n\\njust another day in ‘laker land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time\\n\\nwith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s playin tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the nba’s business end of the season\\n\\ndennis schröder of the los angeles lakers shoots over jonas valančiūnas of the new orleans pelicans kevork djanseziangetty images\\n\\nsteadily improving\\n\\nfor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned nba champion just over two years ago this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers\\n\\nheading into the season general manager rob pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster even with superstars like james and anthony davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for russell westbrook\\n\\nthe acquisition of patrick beverley in august filled a need but many pundits believed that the lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title\\n\\ncriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears james has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the nba’s greatest player\\n\\nso the season began as many predicted with the lakers winning just two of their first 12 games on november 12 the lakers were 14th in the western conference\\n\\nto the credit of firstyear head coach darvin ham and the team’s leading players the lakers dug themselves out of a hole winning eight of their next 10 games\\n\\nbut down to a combination of injuries lack of consistency and a lopsided roster the lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle\\n\\nmidseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – malik beasley d’angelo russell jarred vanderbilt mo bamba and davon reed arriving while westbrook was finally shipped out\\n\\nafter sunday’s win over the mavericks dallas head coach jason kidd said vanderbilt “kicked our as”\\n\\nsince the two trades on february 9 the team has gone 42 and seemingly turned its season on its head\\n\\njames shoots while

playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying\\n\\nbut following the introduction of the playin tournament during the bubble season in the height of the covid19 pandemic a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp\\n\\nthe playin tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs the seventh seeded team hosts the eighth with the winner earning the no 7 seed in the playoffs\\n\\nthe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket\\n\\nit means that at the time of writing the lakers are currently on a threegame winning streak have a record of 2932 and sit 12th in the western conference a game outside the playin tournament they are only twoandahalf games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs\\n\\naccording to the website tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season the lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left\\n\\nit has been a far from perfect season for the lakers so far but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the allstar break\\n\\ntied in the win column with a similarly imperfect portland trail blazers we could well be seeing the 17time nba champion duking it out in the playin – james’ injury permitting\\n\\nwho knows in a congested western conference the

       " 'it’s while running in the moors and hills of her native scotland that lesley paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned\\n\\na professional triathlete and screenwriter paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that on the surface seem worlds apart but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts\\n\\nshe counts among those the opening scenes of the oscarnominated “all quiet on the western front” an adaptation of erich maria remarque’s antiwar novel of the same name published in 1929\\n\\nthe film begins in the trenches of the first world war where much of the action is situated before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany there paul bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider\\n\\nunbeknownst to bäumer who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled\\n\\n“it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man” paterson tells cnn sport\\n\\n“it’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think ‘oh my god … where did this come from’ you feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it”\\n\\nthe scene first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands proved prescient last year russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\\n\\n“if we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change” says paterson\\n\\nfelix kammerer stars as paul bäumer in all quiet on the western front reiner bajonetflix\\n\\nfirst portrayed on screen in a muchloved hollywood film nearly 100 years ago “all quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure\\n\\npaterson alongside writing partner ian stokell got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before netflix commissioned it as a germanlanguage film\\n\\nthe end product which includes a new narrative strand focused on the armistice talks between german and french officials captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail\\n\\nit has been met with great critical acclaim receiving nine oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a recordequaling 14 bafta nominations\\n\\nthe bafta awards ceremony will be held on sunday while the oscars take place on march 13 – two events that for paterson will cap off years of hard work stress and dogged resolve\\n\\na fivetime world champion across two formats of offroad triathlon she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain\\n\\nthat was in 2016 when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain she started to search for a solution\\n\\nwith the help of her husband and her physio she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars leaving only the milelong sea swim to consider\\n\\n“i do a lot of onearm drills” says paterson “i was always really good at it and i’ve got a very strong leg kick i practiced in the ocean and i was like ‘well i can do one arm let’s give this a shot’”\\n\\nafter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field paterson made up ground on the 40kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10kilometer run\\n\\n“i just kind of kept on going” she says “and then i ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box i had to get something done”\\n\\ntriathlete lesley paterson competes for great britain in birmingham alabama in 2012 kevin c coxgetty images\\n\\nthe experience itself worthy of a film script was emblematic of the way paterson approached triathlon throughout her life\\n\\n“i don’t know if that’s the sort of scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly i’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes” she says “i’m a very sort of passionate heartdriven athlete”\\n\\npaterson has mostly competed on the xterra crosstriathlon series – “all offroad and muddy and gritty and out in nature” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the olympics with great britain at the start of her career\\n\\nafter she moved to california in her twenties to further her film studies competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost particularly as she looked to get “all quiet” off the ground\\n\\n“every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money” says paterson\\n\\n“me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected a big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well it was a massive motivation”\\n\\nover the years paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined she has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines driven she says by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail\\n\\n“i’ve always had these two simultaneous passions the artist in me and the athlete in me” says paterson\\n\\n“people think they are often very separate but they’re actually very very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other i’d say that i truly am the athlete i am because i’m an artist and the artist i am because i’m an athlete”\\n\\nall quiet on the western front was released last year and has been highly acclaimed reiner bajonetflix\\n\\nwhether it’s sports or scriptwriting paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in”\\n\\nit perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “all quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry\\n\\nthe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front particularly with the release of sam mendes’ “1917” four years ago\\n\\nand with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema director edward berger and producer malte grunert suggested pitching “all quiet” in german rather than english\\n\\n“there’s an authenticity – it’s their story it’s their national novel it’s rightly so that it’s in german” says paterson\\n\\nthe popularity of “all quiet” may take paterson’s life in a different direction especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over she still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future\\n\\nwhatever she does next paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy\\n\\n“it’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me” she says\\n\\n“as long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … that’s where the beauty comes”',\n",

       " 'for four days this week home for green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers was a pitchblack room there were no phones no television no lights or distractions just rodgers alone with his thoughts in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark\\n\\nwhen the fourtime nfl mvp announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his nfl future in isolation at a “darkness retreat” many were left scratching their heads\\n\\n“it’s just sitting in isolation meditation dealing with your thoughts” rodgers said earlier this month “we rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness i’m really looking forward to it”\\n\\nrodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies he credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of selflove the football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life”\\n\\nbut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat and is it just another newage fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us\\n\\nwhat happens in the dark\\n\\na darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light one of the centers offering the practice is sky cave retreats nestled in the cascadesiskiyou wilderness in southern oregon near klamath falls\\n\\nthe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark sky cave retreats\\n\\n“the reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more to people who want to rest reset and relax to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice” said scott berman who owns sky cave retreats along with his wife jill adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives\\n\\n“when someone goes into the darkness all these things that were important to them like money fame power status being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark” berman said “in the dark all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love forgiveness peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you”\\n\\nthe center currently operates three standalone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earthsheltered caves which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a hobbit home each space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident\\n\\nthe cost includes three meals a day which berman delivers personally all at once in the evening through a lightproof doublesided food box to minimize the disturbance this is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes according to berman depending on the person’s needs\\n\\nparticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of 250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience\\n\\neach space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation sky cave retreats\\n\\nburak dalcik a 27yearold salesman from arlington virginia said the four days he spent in the dark at sky caves retreats in january gave him clarity about his priorities he found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative but rather allowed them to come and to go which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life he also said he started calling his mom who lives back in turkey more frequently\\n\\n“it just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are” said dalcik “there’s nothing new age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself and if you can’t you should probably get pretty curious about why”\\n\\nberman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles\\n\\n“it’s not like this magical mindblowing amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable” berman said “but in the darkness discomfort is the door to transformation there’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves”\\n\\na therapeutic tool or junk science\\n\\nfor now there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain\\n\\n“that’s totally false” said dr david blask the head of the laboratory of chrononeuroendocrine oncology at tulane university school of medicine “there may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint”\\n\\ndr marek malůš a psychologist at the university of ostrava in the czech republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010 sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool\\n\\n“your thoughts memories emotions inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated” malůš said\\n\\nwhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and selfesteem lower symptoms of depression and anxiety while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience\\n\\nberman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high\\n\\n“if somebody’s coming here because they want to have a socalled dmt experience you’ve come into the wrong place” he said “but there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature”\\n\\nfor those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits berman suggests starting small at home\\n\\n“it’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down putting the phone away turning out the lights closing the blinds and just resting” he said “not to get somewhere not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself”',\n",

a 270page report to the body\\n\\nbenn added “however i feel like the wbc statement did a disservice to my defence which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures

antidoping agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their a sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible\\n\\nbenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the court of arbitration for sport\\n\\nbenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before october’s test adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error”\\n\\nwhile benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing\\n\\n“antidoping protections are obviously extremely important but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty cheaters should be caught and punished but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career”\\n\\nbenn admitted that he’d had suicidal

screenwriter paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that on the surface seem worlds apart but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts\\n\\nshe counts among those the opening scenes of the oscarnominated all quiet on the western front an adaptation of erich maria remarque s antiwar novel of the same name published in 1929\\n\\nthe film begins in the trenches of the first world war where much of the action is situated before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany there paul bäumer a young army recruit and the story s protagonist notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider\\n\\nunbeknownst to bäumer who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled\\n\\n it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film that the uniform s more important than the man paterson tells cnn sport\\n\\n it s just one of those moments where you know it s good and you think ‘oh my god … where did this come from you feel so lucky that you ve thought of it \\n\\nthe scene first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands proved prescient last year russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\\n\\n if we can hold up a mirror to what s going on to try and prevent more from happening that truly is my goal as a storyteller to effect change says

even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain\\n\\nthat was in 2016 when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain she started to search for a solution\\n\\nwith the help of her husband and her physio she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars leaving only the milelong sea swim to consider\\n\\n i do a lot of onearm drills says paterson i was always really good at it and i ve got a very strong leg kick i practiced in the ocean and i was like ‘well i can do one arm let s give this a shot \\n\\nafter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field paterson made up ground on the 40kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10kilometer run\\n\\n i just kind of kept on going she says and then i ran off into the forest and it was

mentality or if it s just truly i m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes she says i m a very sort of passionate heartdriven athlete \\n\\npaterson has mostly competed on the xterra crosstriathlon series all offroad and muddy and gritty and out in nature she says having previously missed out on qualifying for the olympics with great britain at the start of her career\\n\\nafter she moved to california in her twenties to further her film studies competing in and winning races became a welcome financial boost particularly as she looked to get all quiet off the ground\\n\\n every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it s a lot of money says paterson\\n\\n me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn t necessarily expected a big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well it was a massive motivation \\n\\nover the years paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined she has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines driven she says by a love for what she s doing and an obsessive attention to detail\\n\\n i ve always had these two simultaneous passions the artist in me and the athlete in me says paterson\\n\\n people think they are often very separate but they re actually very very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other i d say that i truly am the athlete i am because i m an artist and the artist i am because i m an athlete \\n\\nall quiet on the western front was released last year and has been highly acclaimed reiner bajonetflix\\n\\nwhether it s sports or scriptwriting paterson says she has a habit of looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in \\n\\nit perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 the only girl in a team of boys and why she chose to tackle all quiet at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry\\n\\nthe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front particularly with the release of sam mendes 1917 four years ago\\n\\nand with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema director edward berger and producer malte grunert suggested pitching all quiet in german rather than english\\n\\n there s an authenticity it s their story it s their national novel it s rightly so that it s in german says paterson\\n\\nthe popularity of all quiet may take paterson s life in a different direction especially now that she s 42 and her racing career is almost over she still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future\\n\\nwhatever she does next paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy\\n\\n it s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes that was a huge learning curve for me she says\\n\\n as long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and

thoughts in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark\\n\\nwhen the fourtime nfl mvp announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his nfl future in isolation at a darkness retreat many were left scratching their heads\\n\\n it s just sitting in isolation meditation dealing with your thoughts rodgers said earlier this month we rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness i m really looking forward to it \\n\\nrodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies he credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of selflove the football star said he has done many meditation and yoga retreats in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life \\n\\nbut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat and is it just another newage fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us\\n\\nwhat happens in the dark\\n\\na darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light one of the centers offering the practice is sky cave retreats nestled in the cascadesiskiyou wilderness in southern oregon near klamath falls\\n\\nthe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark sky cave retreats\\n\\n the reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more to people who want to rest reset and relax to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice said scott berman who owns sky cave retreats along with his wife jill adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives\\n\\n when someone goes into the darkness all these things that were important to them like money fame power status being worthy they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark berman said in the dark all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful whether it s love forgiveness peace and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you \\n\\nthe center currently operates three standalone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark earthsheltered caves which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a hobbit home each space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation participants can leave at any time the doors are never locked and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn t flipped on by accident\\n\\nthe cost includes three meals a day which berman delivers personally all at once in the evening through a lightproof doublesided food box to minimize the disturbance this is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes according to berman depending on the person s needs\\n\\nparticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of 250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience\\n\\neach space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation sky cave retreats\\n\\nburak dalcik a 27yearold salesman from arlington virginia said the four days he spent in the dark at sky caves retreats in january gave him clarity about his priorities he found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative but rather allowed them to come and to go which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life he also said he started calling his mom who lives back in turkey more frequently\\n\\n it just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are said dalcik there s nothing new age about this it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself and if you can t you should probably get pretty curious about why \\n\\nberman cautions the retreat isn t for everyone nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one s troubles\\n\\n it s not like this magical mindblowing amazing experience it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable berman said but in the darkness discomfort is the door to transformation there s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they re no longer resisting that part of themselves \\n\\na therapeutic tool or junk science\\n\\nfor now there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain\\n\\n that s totally false said dr david blask the head of the laboratory of chrononeuroendocrine oncology at tulane university school of medicine there may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint \\n\\ndr marek malůš a psychologist at the university of ostrava in the czech republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010 sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool\\n\\n your thoughts memories emotions inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated malůš said\\n\\nwhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and selfesteem lower symptoms of depression and anxiety while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience\\n\\nberman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high\\n\\n if somebody s coming here because they want to have a socalled dmt experience you ve come into the wrong place he said but there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature \\n\\nfor those who aren t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits berman suggests starting small at home\\n\\n it s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down putting the phone away turning out the lights closing the blinds and just resting he said not to get somewhere not to heal but just to be curious about what s actually happening within yourself ',\n",

the consequences of failing are so dire penalties for me are wonderful \\n\\nprofessor jordet works at the norwegian school of sport sciences where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure he s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them around 2000 kicks in total\\n\\nhe s studied the psychology of the event observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they re doing\\n\\n the main factor in a penalty shootout is luck the

finals michael reganthe fagetty images\\n\\nlast season s fa cup final was a case in point jordet observed that liverpool s manager jurgen klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle\\n\\nthey spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing several more minutes had passed before chelsea s seemingly fraught manager thomas tuchel approached his players and he was still revising his notes\\n\\n he moves to the middle of the circle before he s done with the plan jordet observed in a tweet thread tuchel then asks his players about the shots publicly in front of the whole team\\n\\n there s plenty of group pressure when done this way the chance of honest responses from the players drops and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself \\n\\nliverpool s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was

himself as a gamechanger in shootouts the machiavelli of football \\n\\njordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents during the semifinal of the copa américa against colombia in 2021 he intimidated his opponents with trash talk saving three penalties in a 32 win\\n\\nsince the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying i can tell you re nervous i know where you re going to shoot watch and see how i m going to eat you up remember i m going to eat you up \\n\\nbut it was in the world cup final against france that martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise\\n\\njordet says that he set the tone right from the start arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own martínez took a very proactive approach to everything jordet explained\\n\\n he created his home in the penalty area he initiated some handshakes with the first french players to arrive a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes\\n\\nargentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the french penalty takers simon stacpooleoffsidegetty images\\n\\nfor the first two french penalties martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot\\n\\nthis kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers but he was also feeling out the referee how much would he be prepared to tolerate\\n\\njordet believes that enabled martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to fully get to work \\n\\nmartínez saved the second penalty that he faced diving low to his right to deny kingsley coman and his celebration was exuberant\\n\\njordet notes that goalkeepers don t typically celebrate so wildly but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events\\n\\n we found to our astonishment that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team\\n\\n in fact the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 1015 of the time and your next teammate scores about 7 to 8 more of their penalties these types of celebratory displays are contagious \\n\\nby the time the third french player stepped up martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything he snatched up the ball turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line\\n\\nthe approaching aurélien tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot instead martínez was holding it gesturing to the argentine fans to increase the volume\\n\\nfrance fans show their support for les bleus during the world cup final catherine ivillgetty images\\n\\nwhen the referee demanded its return martínez rolled it away at a 45degree angle forcing tchouaméni to fetch it himself jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30\\n\\ntchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed\\n\\nby now martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the french goalie hugo lloris so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate leandro paredes one of four argentine penalty takers who all scored\\n\\nmartínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth french player randal kolo muani but by then the damage was done and argentina won the shootout 42\\n\\n very calculated creative well executed jordet concludes but of course also highly highly cynical \\n\\nemiliano martínez of argentina attempted to distract randal kolo muani ahead of his penalty julian finneygetty images\\n\\nmartínez showed very little remorse for his cynical actions after the final he said i have no words for it i was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted \\n\\n all that i have dreamed of has been achieved \\n\\nsince the conclusion of the world cup the international football association board ifab which determines the laws of football confirmed to cnn sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken\\n\\nthis would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts crossbar or goal net\\n\\nshootouts don t always have to be so negative though sometimes they can be won with love\\n\\njordet notes that when lafc s cristian tello missed the first penalty against philadelphia in the mls cup final some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in\\n\\n you re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss you re a part of the

to revel in the cauldron of the shootout while others dread it\\n\\nengland has lost seven of the 10 that it s participated in while the netherlands have lost seven out of eight spain s loss to morocco in 2022 means it s now lost a record four shootouts in the fifa world cup alone\\n\\njordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout even if you weren t involved in it you re more likely to miss conversely success begets success\\n\\nhaving lost to czechoslovakia and the famous antonin panenka penalty in the european championship final in 1976 germany has won six in a row croatia has won its last four and argentina its last three claiming both the copa américa and the world cup\\n\\nmore and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game and 20 professional teams have already turned to jordet s consultancy business for help\\n\\n i totally think there s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science jordet says dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development relationships and psychology are important but not quantifiable\\n\\n i honestly would beg to differ if you know what to look for you can measure a lot of these things in games and this is something i work on every single day i think we will make some big progress in the years to come \\n\\nthe moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat spain in their penalty shootout julian finneygetty images\\n\\njordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives watching every single shootout from the world cup european championship and copa américa since 1976 he s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams\\n\\n i love penalty shootouts he says i think it s the ultimate drama in football \\n\\nand yet much of the nuance he described in the world cup final wouldn t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on tv because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans\\n\\n the details that really mattered the subplot of the event can only be accessed if you re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on youtube\\n\\n tv producers aren t always my friends jordet concludes because they don t look at what i like to look at \\n\\nbut now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach the greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses and sometimes they re missing the best bits',\n",

cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing s drugs testing protocols\\n\\nthe two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans benn and eubank jr were fighting for more than just glory this was a fight for family honor\\n\\nbut on the eve of the bout news of benn failing a drugs test came to light the bout was called off after benn tested positive for clomiphene a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate\\n\\nbenn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in february 2023 the world boxing council wbc issued a statement clearing benn of wrongdoing stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances his highlyelevated consumption of eggs prior to testing offered a reasonable explanation for his failed test\\n\\ndespite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport the 26yearold benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process in particular leveling criticism at the wbc and the british boxing board of control bbbofc the governing body for professional boxing in great britain\\n\\nin a statement posted on his instagram story last week benn said that the manner in which i ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation \\n\\ncnn has contacted the wbc and bbbofc for comment\\n\\ncancellation\\n\\naccording to the us antidoping agency usada clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis the drug is also included on the world antidoping agency s prohibited list under antiestrogenic substances\\n\\nbenn began his statement on instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was grateful for the ultimate finding of being declared innocent of being a drugs cheat he couldn t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation\\n\\n it was the right decision and it was the only one i was willing to accept the easy option would have been to accept a six month ban save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that he wrote\\n\\n at no point did i indicate that i failed any vada tests because of contaminated eggs benn wrote referring to the voluntary antidoping association vada a thirdparty testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test\\n\\n as part of its lengthy investigation the wbc instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause he wrote saying he provided a 270page report to the body\\n\\nbenn added however i feel like the wbc statement did a disservice to my defence which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that i am innocent \\n\\nbenn is still under investigation from uk antidoping ukad and the bbcofc at the time of publication\\n\\nhe criticized the bbcofc s handling of his case in his statement\\n\\n as for the bbboc they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state \\n\\nthe bbcofc released their own statement on twitter after the announcement from the wbc in february saying that it was not party to the review and had not seen any evidence provided on mr benn s behalf \\n\\nit added that while it respects the wbc the wbc is a sanctioning body and not a governing body the bbcofc was the governing body with whom mr benn was licensed at the material time and as such any alleged antidoping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations \\n\\nit pointed to the uk antidoping rules brought in by ukad which the bbcofc adheres to and that as a result the decision of the wbc does not affect the ongoing implantation of the bbcofc s rules and those of ukad \\n\\ncnn has contacted the bbcofc for comment ukad declined to comment when given the opportunity\\n\\nbenn punches chris algieri during their wba continental

relation to benn s sample and test\\n\\nbut benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation claiming that his sample tested negative three times but without explanation was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test\\n\\naccording to benn he asked for his b sample from the drug test which the world antidoping agency says affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their a sample returns a positive test to be tested as soon as possible\\n\\nbenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the court of arbitration for sport\\n\\nbenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before october s test adding to his belief that the result was a testing error \\n\\nwhile benn now says that he had to concentrate on rebuilding his career the process he has gone through has given him serious concerns about the whole testing system in boxing\\n\\n antidoping protections are obviously extremely important but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty cheaters should be caught and punished but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career \\n\\nbenn admitted that he d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process saying i didn t think i d see another day \\n\\n it s hurt me benn said in an interview with piers morgan on talktv i didn t think i was going to make it through this period i didn t think i was going to make it through \\n\\nwhen asked if he had felt suicidal benn replied yeah yeah i d say so and it upsets me now because i don t know how i got so bad i got in a really bad way about it\\n\\n i was shamed for something i hadn t even done … if i had done something wrong i m human i d raise my hands to it ‘i made a mistake whatever it is i raise my hands never this\\n\\n i felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice and leaving my family and the image i maintain was just ruined by somebody else s incompetence it s been hard for the family \\n\\nbackground\\n\\nat the time of benn s positive test last year the bout s promoter matchroom and that organization s boss eddie hearn had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being prohibited by the bbbofc\\n\\nhearn told the bbc at the time as we stand right now the bbbofc is not sanctioning the fight that does not mean the fight is off but there is a process we have to go through\\n\\n conor benn is not suspended he is free and clear to fight

images\\n\\namid mounting public pressure and safety concerns the fight was canceled\\n\\nthe decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight s moneymaking opportunities rather than the boxers safety\\n\\nweeks later the bbbofc claimed that benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against benn were upheld\\n\\nbenn accused the bbbofc of conducting an unfair and biased procedure he also disputes that he relinquished his license\\n\\n benn strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the vada issue and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion a statement said on benn s twitter at the time\\n\\nand a few months later the wbc announced after it had conducted an investigation into

       " 'it s while running in the moors and hills of her native scotland that lesley paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned\\n\\na professional triathlete and screenwriter paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that on the surface seem worlds apart but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts\\n\\nshe counts among those the opening scenes of the oscarnominated all quiet on the western front an adaptation of erich maria remarque s antiwar novel of the same name published in \\n\\nthe film begins in the trenches of the first world war where much of the action is situated before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany there paul bäumer a young army recruit and the story s protagonist notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider\\n\\nunbeknownst to bäumer who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled\\n\\n it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film that the uniform s more important than the man paterson tells cnn sport\\n\\n it s just one of those moments where you know it s good and you think ‘oh my god … where did this come from you feel so lucky that you ve thought of it \\n\\nthe scene first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands proved prescient last year russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\\n\\n if we can hold up a mirror to what s going on to try and prevent more from happening that truly is my goal as a storyteller to effect change says paterson\\n\\nfelix kammerer stars as paul bäumer in all quiet on the western front reiner bajonetflix\\n\\nfirst portrayed on screen in a muchloved hollywood film nearly  years ago all quiet focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure\\n\\npaterson alongside writing partner ian stokell got the option to the rights in  but had to wait until  before netflix commissioned it as a germanlanguage film\\n\\nthe end product which includes a new narrative strand focused on the armistice talks between german and french officials captures the bloodshed and horror of the world s first mechanized war in chilling detail\\n\\nit has been met with great critical acclaim receiving nine oscar nominations including for best adapted screenplay and a recordequaling  bafta nominations\\n\\nthe bafta awards ceremony will be held on sunday while the oscars take place on march  two events that for paterson will cap off years of hard work stress and dogged resolve\\n\\na fivetime world champion across two formats of offroad triathlon she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain\\n\\nthat was in  when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain she started to search for a solution\\n\\nwith the help of her husband and her physio she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars leaving only the milelong sea swim to consider\\n\\n i do a lot of onearm drills says paterson i was always really good at it and i ve got a very strong leg kick i practiced in the ocean and i was like ‘well i can do one arm let s give this a shot \\n\\nafter finishing the swim some  minutes behind the rest of the field paterson made up ground on the kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the kilometer run\\n\\n i just kind of kept on going she says and then i ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box i had to get something done \\n\\ntriathlete lesley paterson competes for great britain in birmingham alabama in  kevin c coxgetty images\\n\\nthe experience itself worthy of a film script was emblematic of the way paterson approached triathlon throughout her life\\n\\n i don t know if that s the sort of scottish underdog mentality or if it s just truly i m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes she says i m a very sort of passionate heartdriven athlete \\n\\npaterson has mostly competed on the xterra crosstriathlon series all offroad and muddy and gritty and out in nature she says having previously missed out on qualifying for the olympics with great britain at the start of her career\\n\\nafter she moved to california in her twenties to further her film studies competing in and winning races became a welcome financial boost particularly as she looked to get all quiet off the ground\\n\\n every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it s a lot of money says paterson\\n\\n me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn t necessarily expected a big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well it was a massive motivation \\n\\nover the years paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined she has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines driven she says by a love for what she s doing and an obsessive attention to detail\\n\\n i ve always had these two simultaneous passions the artist in me and the athlete in me says paterson\\n\\n people think they are often very separate but they re actually very very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other i d say that i truly am the athlete i am because i m an artist and the artist i am because i m an athlete \\n\\nall quiet on the western front was released last year and has been highly acclaimed reiner bajonetflix\\n\\nwhether it s sports or scriptwriting paterson says she has a habit of looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in \\n\\nit perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of  the only girl in a team of boys and why she chose to tackle all quiet at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry\\n\\nthe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front particularly with the release of sam mendes  four years ago\\n\\nand with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema director edward berger and producer malte grunert suggested pitching all quiet in german rather than english\\n\\n there s an authenticity it s their story it s their national novel it s rightly so that it s in german says paterson\\n\\nthe popularity of all quiet may take paterson s life in a different direction especially now that she s  and her racing career is almost over she still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future\\n\\nwhatever she does next paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy\\n\\n it s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes that was a huge learning curve for me she says\\n\\n as long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you re at … that s where the beauty comes ',\n",

thoughts in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark\\n\\nwhen the fourtime nfl mvp announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his nfl future in isolation at a darkness retreat many were left scratching their heads\\n\\n it s just sitting in isolation meditation dealing with your thoughts rodgers said earlier this month we rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness i m really looking forward to it \\n\\nrodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies he credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of selflove the football star said he has done many meditation and yoga retreats in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life \\n\\nbut what exactly happens in a darkness retreat and is it just another newage fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us\\n\\nwhat happens in the dark\\n\\na darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light one of the centers offering the practice is sky cave retreats nestled in the cascadesiskiyou wilderness in southern oregon near klamath falls\\n\\nthe cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark sky cave retreats\\n\\n the reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more to people who want to rest reset and relax to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice said scott berman who owns sky cave retreats along with his wife jill adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives\\n\\n when someone goes into the darkness all these things that were important to them like money fame power status being worthy they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark berman said in the dark all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful whether it s love forgiveness peace and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you \\n\\nthe center currently operates three standalone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark earthsheltered caves which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a hobbit home each space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation participants can leave at any time the doors are never locked and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn t flipped on by accident\\n\\nthe cost includes three meals a day which berman delivers personally all at once in the evening through a lightproof doublesided food box to minimize the disturbance this is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation which could be  seconds or  minutes according to berman depending on the person s needs\\n\\nparticipants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of  a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience\\n\\neach space contains a bed a toilet sink and a bathtub as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation sky cave retreats\\n\\nburak dalcik a yearold salesman from arlington virginia said the four days he spent in the dark at sky caves retreats in january gave him clarity about his priorities he found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative but rather allowed them to come and to go which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life he also said he started calling his mom who lives back in turkey more frequently\\n\\n it just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are said dalcik there s nothing new age about this it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself and if you can t you should probably get pretty curious about why \\n\\nberman cautions the retreat isn t for everyone nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one s troubles\\n\\n it s not like this magical mindblowing amazing experience it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable berman said but in the darkness discomfort is the door to transformation there s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they re no longer resisting that part of themselves \\n\\na therapeutic tool or junk science\\n\\nfor now there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain\\n\\n that s totally false said dr david blask the head of the laboratory of chrononeuroendocrine oncology at tulane university school of medicine there may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint \\n\\ndr marek malůš a psychologist at the university of ostrava in the czech republic who has been studying darkness therapies since  sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool\\n\\n your thoughts memories emotions inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated malůš said\\n\\nwhile he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and selfesteem lower symptoms of depression and anxiety while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience\\n\\nberman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high\\n\\n if somebody s coming here because they want to have a socalled dmt experience you ve come into the wrong place he said but there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature \\n\\nfor those who aren t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits berman suggests starting small at home\\n\\n it s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down putting the phone away turning out the lights closing the blinds and just resting he said not to get somewhere not to heal but just to be curious about what s actually happening within yourself ',\n",

shootouts including the final\\n\\nwithin seconds of the final whistle being blown jordet can tell if one side has the edge he s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field\\n\\n the coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties jordet explained to cnn sport it seems like they don t know what to do and then with other teams it s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties \\n\\njurgen klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for liverpool in the league and fa cup finals michael reganthe fagetty images\\n\\nlast season s fa cup final was a case in point jordet observed that liverpool s manager jurgen klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within  seconds of the final whistle\\n\\nthey spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing several more minutes had passed before chelsea s seemingly fraught manager thomas tuchel approached his players and he was still revising his notes\\n\\n he moves to the middle of the circle before he s done with the plan jordet observed in a tweet thread tuchel then asks his players about the shots publicly in front of the whole team\\n\\n there s plenty of group pressure when done this way the chance of honest responses from the players drops and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself \\n\\nliverpool s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff where klopp continued to exude warmth and love\\n\\nchelsea went on to miss two penalties and liverpool claimed the trophy\\n\\nworld cup final penalty masterclass\\n\\nnobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper who is involved in every single kick jordet s research has confirmed that the goalies aren t just there to stop the shots they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents\\n\\nin recent seasons argentina s yearold goalkeeper emiliano martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts the machiavelli of football \\n\\njordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents during the semifinal of the copa américa against colombia in  he intimidated his opponents with trash talk saving three penalties in a  win\\n\\nsince the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying i can tell you re nervous i know where you re going to shoot watch and see how i m going to eat you up remember i m going to eat you up \\n\\nbut it was in the world cup final against france that martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise\\n\\njordet says that he set the tone right from the start arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own martínez took a very proactive approach to everything jordet explained\\n\\n he created his home in the penalty area he initiated some handshakes with the first french players to arrive a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes\\n\\nargentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the french penalty takers simon stacpooleoffsidegetty images\\n\\nfor the first two french penalties martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot\\n\\nthis kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers but he was also feeling out the referee how much would he be prepared to tolerate\\n\\njordet believes that enabled martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to fully get to work \\n\\nmartínez saved the second penalty that he faced diving low to his right to deny kingsley coman and his celebration was exuberant\\n\\njordet notes that goalkeepers don t typically celebrate so wildly but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events\\n\\n we found to our astonishment that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team\\n\\n in fact the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about  of the time and your next teammate scores about  to  more of their penalties these types of celebratory displays are contagious \\n\\nby the time the third french player stepped up martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything he snatched up the ball turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line\\n\\nthe approaching aurélien tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot instead martínez was holding it gesturing to the argentine fans to increase the volume\\n\\nfrance fans show their support for les bleus during the world cup final catherine ivillgetty images\\n\\nwhen the referee demanded its return martínez rolled it away at a degree angle forcing tchouaméni to fetch it himself jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick the probability of a goal drops by  to \\n\\ntchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed\\n\\nby now martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the french goalie hugo lloris so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate leandro paredes one of four argentine penalty takers who all scored\\n\\nmartínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth french player randal kolo muani but by then the damage was done and argentina won the shootout \\n\\n very calculated creative well executed jordet concludes but of course also highly highly cynical \\n\\nemiliano martínez of argentina attempted to distract randal kolo muani ahead of his penalty julian finneygetty images\\n\\nmartínez showed very little remorse for his cynical actions after the final he said i have no words for it i was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted \\n\\n all that i have dreamed of has been achieved \\n\\nsince the conclusion of the world cup the international football association board ifab which determines the laws of football confirmed to cnn sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken\\n\\nthis would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts crossbar or goal net\\n\\nshootouts don t always have to be so negative though sometimes they can be won with love\\n\\njordet notes that when lafc s cristian tello missed the first penalty against philadelphia in the mls cup final some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in\\n\\n you re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss you re a part of the group which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout \\n\\nlos angeles made every other kick to claim the cup\\n\\nthe power of intangibles\\n\\nsome teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout while others dread it\\n\\nengland has lost seven of the  that it s participated in while the netherlands have lost seven out of eight spain s loss to morocco in  means it s now lost a record four shootouts in the fifa world cup alone\\n\\njordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout even if you weren t involved in it you re more likely to miss conversely success begets success\\n\\nhaving lost to czechoslovakia and the famous antonin panenka penalty in the european championship final in  germany has won six in a row croatia has won its last four and argentina its last three claiming both the copa américa and the world cup\\n\\nmore and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game and  professional teams have already turned to jordet s consultancy business for help\\n\\n i totally think there s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science jordet says dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development relationships and psychology are important but not quantifiable\\n\\n i honestly would beg to differ if you know what to look for you can measure a lot of these things in games and this is something i work on every single day i think we will make some big progress in the years to come \\n\\nthe moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat spain in their penalty shootout julian finneygetty images\\n\\njordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives watching every single shootout from the world cup european championship and copa américa since  he s interviewed  players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with  elite teams\\n\\n i love penalty shootouts he says i think it s the ultimate drama in football \\n\\nand yet much of the nuance he described in the world cup final wouldn t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on tv because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans\\n\\n the details that really mattered the subplot of the event can only be accessed if you re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on youtube\\n\\n tv producers aren t always my friends jordet concludes because they don t look at what i like to look at \\n\\nbut now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach the greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses and sometimes they re missing the best bits',\n",

cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing s drugs testing protocols\\n\\nthe two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly  years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans benn and eubank jr were fighting for more than just glory this was a fight for family honor\\n\\nbut on the eve of the bout news of benn failing a drugs test came to light the bout was called off after benn tested positive for clomiphene a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate\\n\\nbenn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in february  the world boxing council wbc issued a statement clearing benn of wrongdoing stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances his highlyelevated consumption of eggs prior to testing offered a reasonable explanation for his failed test\\n\\ndespite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport the yearold benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process in particular leveling criticism at the wbc and the british boxing board of control bbbofc the governing body for professional boxing in great britain\\n\\nin a statement posted on his instagram story last week benn said that the manner in which i ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation \\n\\ncnn has contacted the wbc and bbbofc for comment\\n\\ncancellation\\n\\naccording to the us antidoping agency usada clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis the drug is also included on the world antidoping agency s prohibited list under antiestrogenic substances\\n\\nbenn began his statement on instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was grateful for the ultimate finding of being declared innocent of being a drugs cheat he couldn t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation\\n\\n it was the right decision and it was the only one i was willing to accept the easy option would have been to accept a six month ban save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that he wrote\\n\\n at no point did i indicate that i failed any vada tests because of contaminated eggs benn wrote referring to the voluntary antidoping association vada a thirdparty testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test\\n\\n as part of its lengthy investigation the wbc instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause he wrote saying he provided a page report to the body\\n\\nbenn added however i feel like the wbc statement did a disservice to my defence which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that i am innocent \\n\\nbenn is still under investigation from uk antidoping ukad and the bbcofc at the time of publication\\n\\nhe criticized the bbcofc s handling of his case in his statement\\n\\n as for the bbboc they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state \\n\\nthe bbcofc released their own statement on twitter after the announcement from the wbc in february saying that it was not party to the review and had not seen any evidence provided on mr benn s behalf \\n\\nit added that while it respects the wbc the wbc is a sanctioning body and not a governing body the bbcofc was the governing body with whom mr benn was licensed at the material time and as such any alleged antidoping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations \\n\\nit pointed to the uk antidoping rules brought in by ukad which the bbcofc adheres to and that as a result the decision of the wbc does not affect the ongoing implantation of the bbcofc s rules and those of ukad \\n\\ncnn has contacted the bbcofc for comment ukad declined to comment when given the opportunity\\n\\nbenn punches chris algieri during their wba continental welterweight title fight on december   alex liveseygetty images\\n\\n‘serious concerns \\n\\nthe wbc s february ruling stated that they had found there to be no failures in the procedures in relation to benn s sample and test\\n\\nbut benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation claiming that his sample tested negative three times but without explanation was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test\\n\\naccording to benn he asked for his b sample from the drug test which the world antidoping agency says affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their a sample returns a positive test to be tested as soon as possible\\n\\nbenn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the court of arbitration for sport\\n\\nbenn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before october s test adding to his belief that the result was a testing error \\n\\nwhile benn now says that he had to concentrate on rebuilding his career the process he has gone through has given him serious concerns about the whole testing system in boxing\\n\\n antidoping protections are obviously extremely important but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty cheaters should be caught and punished but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career \\n\\nbenn admitted that he d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process saying i didn t think i d see another day \\n\\n it s hurt me benn said in an interview with piers morgan on talktv i didn t think i was going to make it through this period i didn t think i was going to make it through \\n\\nwhen asked if he had felt suicidal benn replied yeah yeah i d say so and it upsets me now because i don t know how i got so bad i got in a really bad way about it\\n\\n i was shamed for something i hadn t even done … if i had done something wrong i m human i d raise my hands to it ‘i made a mistake whatever it is i raise my hands never this\\n\\n i felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice and leaving my family and the image i maintain was just ruined by somebody else s incompetence it s been hard for the family \\n\\nbackground\\n\\nat the time of benn s positive test last year the bout s promoter matchroom and that organization s boss eddie hearn had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being prohibited by the bbbofc\\n\\nhearn told the bbc at the time as we stand right now the bbbofc is not sanctioning the fight that does not mean the fight is off but there is a process we have to go through\\n\\n conor benn is not suspended he is free and clear to fight there s lots going on with the lawyers \\n\\neddie hearn boxing promoter of matchroom boxing speaks at the press conference ahead of benns scheduled fight with eubank jr alex broadwaygetty images\\n\\namid mounting public pressure and safety concerns the fight was canceled\\n\\nthe decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight s moneymaking opportunities rather than the boxers safety\\n\\nweeks later the bbbofc claimed that benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against benn were upheld\\n\\nbenn accused the bbbofc of conducting an unfair and biased procedure he also disputes that he relinquished his license\\n\\n benn strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the vada issue and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion a statement said on benn s twitter at the time\\n\\nand a few months later the wbc announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene ',\n",
