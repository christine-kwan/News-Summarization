We have to start work earlier before we know where we will end up position-wise and European competition-wise. These things are clear.\"\\n\\nLiverpool are six-times Champions League winners, last lifting the trophy in 2018-19.\\n\\n\"I think we played five years in a row in the Champions League, which is massive money, and went to the final three times in that time, which is also massive from a money point of view,\" added Klopp, whose team play at Crystal Palace later on Saturday.\\n\\n\"We built a stand, we built a training ground, and the club is in a really good place, but around us obviously a few people (clubs) are speeding up a little bit and you cannot ignore that.

The higher you go, the more pressure you have on how you are as a person.\"\\n\\nSince Potter took the job in September after the sacking of Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea have won nine of their 25 games.\\n\\n\"I want to succeed here. There is this nonsense that I don\\'t care. Where does that come from? Where\\'s your evidence on that?,\" he added, ahead of Sunday\\'s trip to Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\n\"If you go to work and somebody\\'s swearing abuse at you, it\\'s not going to be pleasant.\\n\\n\"You can answer it two ways.

It\\'s just one of those things,\" Potter told Sky Sports.\\n\\nAsked if it had rocked him, he said: \"Not really. It\\'s just a throwaway line, I think. I don\\'t give it any more weight than that.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not pleasant and it\\'s not pleasant for the family.
