The rapidly expanding fireball of luminous matter they detailed defied their expectations.\\n\\nThe two neutron stars, with a combined mass about 2.7 times that of our sun, had orbited each other for billions of years before colliding at high speeds and exploding. This unfolded in a galaxy called NGC 4993, about 140-150 million light years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Hydra. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion km.\\n\\nThe existence of kilonova explosions was proposed in 1974 and confirmed in 2013, but what they looked like was unknown until this one was detected in 2017 and studied intensively.\\n\\n\"It is a perfect explosion in several ways. It is beautiful, both aesthetically, in the simplicity of the shape, and in its physical significance,\" said astrophysicist Albert Sneppen of the Cosmic Dawn Center in Copenhagen, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.\\n\\n\"Aesthetically, the colours the kilonova emits quite literally look like a sun - except, of course, being a few hundred million times larger in surface area. Physically, this spherical explosion contains the extraordinary physics at the heart of this merger,\" Sneppen added.\\n\\nThe researchers had expected the explosion to perhaps look like a flattened disk - a colossal luminous cosmic pancake, possibly with a jet of material streaming out of it.\\n\\n\"To be honest, we are really going back to the drawing board with this,\" Cosmic Dawn Center astrophysicist and study co-author Darach Watson said.\\n\\n\"Given the extreme nature of the physical conditions - far more extreme than a nuclear explosion, for example, with densities greater than an atomic nucleus, temperatures of billions of degrees and magnetic fields strong enough to distort the shapes of atoms - there may well be fundamental physics here that we don\\'t understand yet,\" Watson added.\\n\\nThe kilonova was studied using the European Southern Observatory\\'s Chile-based Very Large Telescope.\\n\\nThe two neutron stars began their lives as massive normal stars in a two-star system called a binary. Each exploded and collapsed after running out of fuel, leaving behind a small and dense core about 20km in diameter but packing more mass than the sun.\\n\\nVery gradually, they drew nearer to each other, orbiting at a speedy clip. Each were stretched out and pulled apart in the final seconds before the merger because of the power of the other\\'s gravitational field. Their inner parts collided at about 25 per cent of the speed of light, creating the most intense magnetic fields in the universe. The explosion unleashed the luminosity of about a billion suns for a few days.\\n\\nThe two briefly formed a single massive neutron star that then collapsed to form a black hole, an even denser object with gravity so fierce that not even light can escape.\\n\\nThe outer parts of the neutron stars, meanwhile, were stretched into long streamers, with some material flung into space. During the process, the densities and temperatures were so intense that heavy elements were forged, including gold, platinum, arsenic, uranium and iodine.\\n\\nThe researchers offered some hypotheses to explain the spherical shape of the explosion, including energy released from the short-lived single neutron star\\'s enormous magnetic field or the role of enigmatic particles called neutrinos.\\n\\n\"This is fundamentally astonishing, and an exciting challenge for any theoreticians and numerical simulations,\" Sneppen said. \"The game is on.\"',\n",

       " 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com//sustainability/rising-seas-risk-death-sentence-some-nations-un-chief-3278856': \"UNITED NATIONS: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday (Feb 14) that sea levels will rise significantly even if global warming is “miraculously” limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius and said Earth is more likely on a path to warming that amounts to “a death sentence” for countries vulnerable to that rise.\\n\\nEvery fraction of a degree counts, since sea level rise could double if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, and increase exponentially with further temperature increases, the UN chief said. He spoke at the opening of a UN Security Council meeting on sea level rise, which was hearing from 75 countries, and said the council has a critical role in building support for actions to fight climate change.\\n\\nUnder any scenario, countries like Bangladesh, China, India and the Netherlands are all at risk, and large cities on every continent will face serious impacts, including Cairo, Lagos, Maputo, Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, New York, Buenos Aires and Santiago, he added.\\n\\nThe World Meteorological Organization released figures Tuesday, cited by Guterres, that say global mean sea level will rise by about 2m to 3m over the next 2,000 years if warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius. With a 2-degree Celsius increase, seas could rise up to 6m, and with a 5-degree Celsius increase, seas could rise up to 22m, according to the WMO.\\n\\n“Our world is hurtling past the 1.5-degree warming limit that a liveable future requires, and with present policies, is careening towards 2.8 degrees - a death sentence for vulnerable countries,” Guterres said.\\n\\nGuterres said the danger is especially acute for nearly 900 million people who live in coastal zones at low elevations, or one out of every 10 people worldwide.\\n\\nThe consequences are unthinkable, Guterres said: Low-lying communities and entire countries could disappear, the world would witness a mass exodus of entire populations on a biblical scale and competition would become ever fiercer for fresh water, land and other resources.\\n\\nGuterres has been trying to call the world's attention to the dangers posed by climate change, to spur action. In October, he warned that the world is in “a life-or-death struggle” for survival as “ climate chaos gallops ahead” and accused the world’s 20 wealthiest countries of failing to do enough to stop the planet from overheating.\\n\\nIn November, he said the planet is heading toward irreversible “climate chaos” and urged global leaders to put the world back on track to cut emissions, keep promises on climate financing and help developing countries speed their transition to renewable energy.\\n\\nThe landmark Paris agreement adopted in 2015 to address climate change called for global temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nGuterres said the world must address the climate crisis as the root cause of rising seas, and the Security Council has a critical role to play in building the political will required.\",\n",

This is the Amihan season in the Philippines, where days are defined by the onset of the northeast monsoon, cooler temperatures and trade winds.\\n\\nBelow the surface of the water nearby, there is turbulence too. Soft corals undulate in the strong current and small colourful fish seek refuge as waves break on the reef.\\n\\nOther underwater visitors to Apo Island off the coast of Negros do not seem to mind the conditions though.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreen sea turtles have found a safe haven just metres from the shoreline of this fishing community. Unafraid of snorkelling tourists, the turtles graze in the murky shallows on a rich supply of seagrass. Locals estimate there could be up to 250 turtles that frequent the island’s waters, a rare phenomenon that has boosted the fledgling economy here and injected further momentum to protect marine life.',\n",
