Australia won the Women’s T20 World Cup in brilliant fashion, defeating home side South Africa by 19 runs in front of a sold out Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town on Saturday

Victory once again underlined Australia’s dominance in the sport, as the team completed a repeat three-peat under captain Meg Lanning and won the tournament for the sixth time in seven editions.

“It is a pretty special effort from the group,” Lanning told Sky Sports afterwards.

“We felt we had a good score and felt confident if we could hit our areas. We set the tone in an excellent powerplay. We have a special group, not just the players but also the support staff.”

After Lanning won the toss and elected to bat first, the Australian openers, Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney, navigated their way through the first few overs as the home crowd urged on the South African attack.

Healy fell in the fifth over, caught by Nadine de Klerk off Marizanne Kapp’s bowling, but Mooney stayed at the crease for an impressive unbeaten 74 off just 53 balls.

She showcased her full range of shots during her innings, anchoring her side’s score, as frugal South African bowling largely restricted the Australians from posting a sizeable score.

Ash Gardner, who was named player of the tournament, contributed an important cameo of 29 off 21 balls while Mooney’s 11 runs in the last over helped Australia to a respectable 156-6.

It seemed an achievable, if tricky, target for South Africa to reach but a slow start left them 22/1 after six overs and with too much ground to claw back.

Although South Africa accelerated late on, led by Laura Wolvaardt’s 61 from 48 balls, accurate bowling and crisp fielding stifled any comeback and secured Australia’s victory."," Australia won the Women’s T20 World Cup in brilliant fashion, defeating home side South Africa by 19 runs in front of a sold out Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town on SaturdayVictory once again underlined Australia’s dominance in the sport, as the team completed a repeat three-peat under captain Meg Lanning and won the tournament for the sixth time in seven editions.“It is a pretty special effort from the group,” Lanning told Sky Sports afterwards.“We felt we had a good score and felt confident if we could hit our areas.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"," Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells  Sports.Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust.

In February 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour start at the Riviera Country Club in California.

Thursday – 31 years, 15 major triumphs and 82 PGA Tour wins later – a very different Woods, one pained by injury, played at the same venue for the Genesis Invitational, a tournament he hosts where proceeds go to his TGR Foundation.

Yet, in terms of his mentality, it will be the same Woods at the tee.

“If I’m playing in the event, I’m going to try and beat you,” Woods told reporters Tuesday.

“So I don’t understand that making the cut’s a great thing. If I entered the event, it’s always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it’s probably sooner rather than later, but wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that’s not in my DNA.”

Woods started the tournament Thursday with a 2-under par 69, with birdies on his final three holes. He was five shots back of tournament leaders Max Homa and Keith Mitchell.

After suffering serious leg injuries in a car accident in February 2021, the story of the 47-year-old’s recent career has been of one decimated by injury and a grueling recovery process.

Woods’ participation in California this week marks his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July last year and only his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.

There were a couple of cameos in December – a father-son outing at the PNC Championship and a friendly battle at TNT’s The Match – but even in those, he looked to be visibly struggling with movement at various points.

His position on playing a limited schedule, picking and choosing a select number of tournaments, remains the same, with Woods earmarking The Masters at Augusta as a potential target. While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.

“I can still hit shots, but it’s the walking endurance that’s hard,” he said.

“That’s something that we’ve had to work on, walking distances on the beach, just basically stress it out but also be able to recover by the next day and see how it is inflammation-wise and then keep practicing.

“I may have overdone it a couple times here or there, but here I am.”

Record in sight

Woods arrives in California on the precipice of greatness. His victory at the 2019 ZOZO Championship tied legendary compatriot Sam Snead for the all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins, meaning that one more triumph would see Woods become the outright leader.

Snead’s feat was a benchmark that once seemed insurmountable until a prodigious talent emerged at the turn of the century. Sound familiar? Earlier this month, LeBron James sunk his 38,388th career point to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.

“What he [James] accomplished is absolutely incredible – just the durability, the consistency and the longevity,” Woods said.

“I grew up watching Kareem here … that record we never thought it would be surpassed. What LeBron is doing – but also the amount of minutes he’s playing – no one’s ever done that at that age, to be able to play all five positions, that’s never been done before at this level for this long.

“As far as our equivalent to that, I don’t know, maybe you look at maybe me and Sam [Snead] at 82? It takes a career to get to those numbers. That’s how I think probably best how you look at it.”

Woods Thursday was part of a star-studded grouping, playing alongside four-time major winner Rory McIlroy and two-time major champion Justin Thomas. A smiling Woods finished with five birdies and three bogeys in his round, while McIlroy shot a 4-under 67 and Thomas carded a 68.

McIlroy is vying to instantly reclaim the world No. 1 spot he lost to Scottie Scheffler on Sunday when the American defended his crown at the Phoenix Open. The victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.

“Tiger means so much to us as players out here on Tour and he’s done so much for us out here that it’s fun for us to be able to see him still continue to do what he loves,” he told reporters Tuesday.

“It was pretty scary a few years ago when he got in that accident and we didn’t know if he was going to be able to do this again, and so just to have him out here on the grounds and to see him around doing what he loves to do is a lot of fun for us.”

A new look PGA Tour

A $3.6 million winner’s reward will be up for grabs, though defending champion Joaquin Niemann will not be in California to defend his title. The Genesis Invitational is one of the PGA Tour’s “designated events,” offering a boosted prize purse of $20 million to rival the offerings of the LIV Golf Tour, of which Niemann is a part of.

On Tuesday, Woods said that while there were “mixed emotions” among players on the Tour’s new format, he was optimistic about its development.

“From a marketing side of it and from the Tour side of it and the future of our sport, it’s been very positive,” Woods said.

“We need to keep going with it and need to stay aligned and keep progressing and making it better. We need to produce the best product we possibly can to sell to all the viewerships.

“It’s about us creating the best products so we have more eyes on it, more stars, people want to come out and either watch the game of golf, participate, either on social media or the different streaming platforms,” he added.

Speaking Wednesday, McIlroy said the feedback he had received about the designated events echoed what Woods had heard.

“It’s the top half of the membership being really happy that they’re in them and… but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they’re always going to be on the outside looking in,” McIroy told reporters.

“I think that the big thing has been, ‘Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week?’ And it’s not. This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That’s not going to be taken away.

“It’s just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that’s a good thing. Like I’m not saying that we’re going to have field sizes of 50, it’s going to be closer to what you’ve seen in the past. We’re not trying to limit opportunities out here, but we also want to make sure that when people get opportunities, it’s the most competitive, most competitive tournaments and the most competitive product that we can put out there.”"," In February 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour start at the Riviera Country Club in California.Thursday – 31 years, 15 major triumphs and 82 PGA Tour wins later – a very different Woods, one pained by injury, played at the same venue for the Genesis Invitational, a tournament he hosts where proceeds go to his TGR Foundation.Yet, in terms of his mentality, it will be the same Woods at the tee.“If I’m playing in the event, I’m going to try and beat you,” Woods told reporters Tuesday.“So I don’t understand that making the cut’s a great thing.

Tim Bradbury/Getty ImagesSpeaking Wednesday, McIlroy said the feedback he had received about the designated events echoed what Woods had heard.“It’s the top half of the membership being really happy that they’re in them and… but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they’re always going to be on the outside looking in,” McIroy told reporters.“I think that the big thing has been, ‘Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week?’ And it’s not. This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That’s not going to be taken away.“It’s just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that’s a good thing. Like I’m not saying that we’re going to have field sizes of 50, it’s going to be closer to what you’ve seen in the past. We’re not trying to limit opportunities out here, but we also want to make sure that when people get opportunities, it’s the most competitive, most competitive tournaments and the most competitive product that we can put out there.”",,"California, Match, Sound, American","Tiger Woods, Woods, Max Homa, Keith, Robert, Cliff, Sam Snead, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James, Kareem, Sam, Snead, David, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Thomas, Scottie Scheffler, Scheffler, Joaquin Niemann, Niemann, Tim","PGA Tour, Riviera Country Club, Genesis Invitational, TGR, Open, ZOZO, PNC, TNT, Masters, Augusta, sightWoods, PGA, LeBron James, NBA, LeBron, McIlroy, Phoenix Open, LIV Golf Tour, McIroy","the,Riviera,Country,Club,Woods,Genesis,Invitational,TGR,Foundation,PGA,Tour,TNT,Cliff,Hawkins,/,Getty,ImagesRecord,NBA,Scheffler,The,’s,McIlroy",California,"Tiger, Woods, Max, Homa, Keith, Mitchell, Robert, Beck, /, Sports, Illustrated, Getty, ImagesAfter, LeBron, James, Kareem, Abdul, -, Jabbar, Sam, David, Cannon, ImagesWoods, Rory, McIlroy, Justin, Thomas, Scottie, Scheffler, Joaquin, Niemann, Tim, Bradbury",

It was an impressive and eventful third round from Tiger Woods at the Genesis Invitational, one which included his first eagle in three years – and a drive that ended up in a spectator’s jacket.

It was Woods’ shot on the 13th hole at the Riviera Country Club that veered off to the right and somehow found its way into a fan’s jacket.

“All of a sudden he hit, and nobody knows where it went,” the fan later told the PGA Tour. “I looked and I had this bump in my pocket, you know my jacket which I had wrapped around … and I pulled it off and a ball dropped off and it was his.”

After receiving a free ball drop, Woods went on to save par. He had earlier hit an eagle on his 1st hole, his first since the 2020 Genesis Invitational.

He ended the round with an impressive four-under 67, shooting three birdies and an eagle for his best round of the week and the third-lowest score of the day.

Woods was asked if his performance was the best since winning the Masters in 2019: “Yes, yes, it is. It’s the best I’ve played,” Woods told reporters.

A second-round 74 meant Woods had only just made the cut to compete in the final two rounds of a tournament for the first time since last year’s PGA Championship, which he withdrew from before the final round

After suffering serious leg injuries in a car accident two years ago, Woods has made sporadic competitive appearances as he battles with a grueling recovery process.

Playing at the Genesis Invitational this week marks his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July and his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.

“It’s just a matter of whether I can get from point A to point B,” Woods said Saturday, per the PGA Tour. “That’s been the struggle part of it. I can hit shots, I can hit balls on the range, I can chip, I can putt. It’s just getting from point A to point B has been the biggest challenge.”

“We’ll go ahead and reassess everything and see where we are, see how I recover from a full tournament,” Woods added. “I haven’t done this in a while. The last time I did it was at The Open Championship, so it’s been a while. Hopefully the body will still feel good sometime later next week. As of right now, recovery time will be fun.”

The 15-time major winner is three under par for the tournament, 12 shots off leader Jon Rahm who is on 15 under. The 47-year-old will tee off at 11:16am ET in the final round on Sunday.

He has had a controversial week in California. After his second round he said he was sorry “if I offended anybody” after being criticized for handing fellow golfer Justin Thomas a tampon during the first round.

YouTuber Jake Paul suffered the first defeat of his fledgling boxing career on Sunday night as pro boxer-turned reality TV star Tommy Fury edged him out in a split decision in Saudi Arabia.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh.

“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said after the fight. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show “Love Island.”

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted – Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent’s head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that’s often only allowed for short periods of time.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury’s favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday’s fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

“All respect to Tommy, he won, don’t judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I’ll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,” Paul said after the fight.

Paul only began boxing in 2018, but had since gone on to record six wins prior to Sunday – including four knockouts. Fury, however, was the first professional boxer Paul faced."," YouTuber Jake Paul suffered the first defeat of his fledgling boxing career on Sunday night as pro boxer-turned reality TV star Tommy Fury edged him out in a split decision in Saudi Arabia.Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh.“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said after the fight. “This, to me, is a world title fight.

Paris Saint-Germain took control of the title race in Ligue 1 on Sunday with a huge 3-0 win away at bitter rival Marseille to extend its lead at the top of the table to eight points.

It was a masterclass in attacking football from Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi, who combined for all three of PSG’s goals and reached individual milestones in the process.

Messi scored the 700th club goal of his career, a number matched only by Cristiano Ronaldo, while Mbappé become PSG’s joint-record scorer with his 200th goal for the club.

Mbappé reached his second century of goals in just 246 games, per Opta, 55 games less than Edinson Cavani took to reach the landmark.

“He is the best striker in the world, that’s for sure, because he plays with speed and everything he does he does quickly,” PSG head coach Christophe Galtier told reporters.

“He does it with great intensity and he knows how to be present in big matches, that’s also the sign of a great player.”

Marseille had got the better of PSG earlier this month, knocking the Parisians out of the French Cup, and started Sunday’s game the better of the two teams.

However, unable to take advantage of its early dominance, Marseille paid the price as a rampant PSG took control of the match.

Messi and Mbappé both scored and assisted a goal to give PSG a comfortable 2-0 lead at half time, though Marseille will have gone into the break relieved it wasn’t at least five goals down.

Mbappé then scored the pick of the goals 10 minutes into the second half to end the match as a contest, running onto Messi’s scooped through ball and volleying first time into the bottom corner.

Despite a flurry of late action from Marseille, there was to be no comeback in Le Classique as PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma produced a couple of fine saves to give the team its first clean sheet since a 7-0 victory over sixth-tier Pays de Cassel in January.

However, it wasn’t all good news for PSG as defender Presnel Kimpembe was stretchered off early in the first half with what Galtier later confirmed was a ruptured Achilles tendon.

Galtier was involved in an angry confrontation with some Marseille fans behind the PSG dugout at full time, having to be dragged away by the rest of his coaching staff.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.

An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.

And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.

He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.

As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.

Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.

Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.

Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.

It was the 60th time Duplantis has jumped clear of six meters or higher as he continues his dominant career.

Ukrainian pole vault legend Sergey Bubka was the first man to surpass the six meter mark when he did so in 1985. He held the world record until Lavillenie outjumped his mark in an event in Bubka’s home city of Donetsk which had him in attendance."," He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.🚨 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐃 𝐃𝐔 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐃𝐄 ! 🌎🤩 Phénoménal ! 🇸🇪 Armand Duplantis est sur le toit du monde à Clermont-Ferrand en s'élevant à 6️⃣,2️⃣2️⃣ m !Il faudra bientôt relever le plafond ! 😱📺 Revivez le @AllStarPerche en 𝗥𝗘𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬 sur https://t.co/xgXE6U6Tof pic.twitter.com/ihgsZ81aoh  FFAthlétisme (@FFAthletisme) February 25, 2023Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.Duplantis (right) celebrates after setting a new pole vault world record with Lavillenie (left).

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart.

Manchester United won its first trophy since 2017 with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United to win the Carabao Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.

Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.

Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German’s despairing fingertips – it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.

The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.

“It’s an amazing feeling, we’ve been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,” Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.

“It’s been an amazing period. The first trophy of the season but we want more. It’s not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards deserve more.”

Turnaround

It was a final longtime coming for both teams for different reasons.

For Manchester United, the club hasn’t won a trophy since 2017; a cataclysmic expanse for the club the size of it.

In the black and white of Newcastle, it is an even longer wait, having not won any major silverware for 54 years.

It is also the first final for the club since its controversial takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2021.

The PIF – which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium – is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

With thousands of fans having made the journey down to London from Newcastle for the final, Wembley’s atmosphere had a proper cup final feel to it.

And to the delight of Manchester United fans, their local hero and the team’s man in form, Rashford, was declared fit to start despite a recent injury scare. Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.

In the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.

When it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.

The Brazilian midfielder was signed by manager Ten Hag in a £60 million ($73m) deal from Real Madrid in the summer and his impact as the heart of the team has been indicative of Manchester United’s rise since Ten Hag’s arrival at the club.

Things went from bad to worse for Newcastle minutes later when some neat link up play between Rashford and Wout Weghorst saw the England star played into the opposition’s box. Although he was able to get away a left-footed shot under pressure from Botman, Rashford’s shot looked to have been heading wide meaning the goal was credited to the Netherlands defender.

After the halftime break, Newcastle ramped up its pressure on David de Gea’s goal, with Saint-Maximin and the newly-introduced Alexander Isak doing their best to fashion goalscoring opportunities.

The final two minutes were filled with set pieces, substitutions and breakaway chances – with Manchester United actually looking the most likely to score.

In the dying seconds, with the result seemingly wrapped up, Portugal international Fernandes had a glorious opportunity to cap off a memorable afternoon, only for Karius to produce a smart stop.

In the end, Manchester United was able to run down the remainder of the clock, end its six-year trophy wait – the club’s longest wait for a major trophy since 1983 – and possibly usher in a new era at the club.

“It’s a mixture of all the emotions. It’s massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it’s something we’ve missed as a club,” Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.

“The fact we’ve come all this way and won it, it’s a massive feeling. Hopefully it pushes us now to keep going. There’s hunger to add more finals like this. I’ve been in finals where we’ve won and lost. It’s massive for us as a club and individuals and it’s part of our history. We want to keep adding to that.”

He added: “We want to be involved in a lot of games and that means we’ve got to stay in the competitions. If we want to win things, we have to keep pushing.”

For Newcastle, it was yet more disappointment at Wembley as it has now lost each of its last nine matches at the stadium, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final, extending what is the longest ever losing run by a club side at the venue."," Manchester United won its first trophy since 2017 with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United to win the Carabao Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German’s despairing fingertips – it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.“It’s an amazing feeling, we’ve been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,” Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.“It’s been an amazing period.

There have been a lot of dull outfits on the fairways over the years – monochrome colors, polo shirts, and plain caps galore. Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

When the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a “darkness retreat,” many were left scratching their heads.

“It’s just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,” Rodgers said earlier this month. “We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I’m really looking forward to it.”

Rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.”

But what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?

What happens in the dark

A darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats, nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.

The cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark. Sky Cave Retreats

“The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,” said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.

“When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,” Berman said. “In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love, forgiveness, peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.”

The center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident.

The cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person’s needs.

Participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.

Burak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.

“It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,” said Dalcik. “There’s nothing New Age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can’t, you should probably get pretty curious about why.”

Berman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles.

“It’s not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,” Berman said. “But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves.”

A therapeutic tool or junk science?

For now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.

“That’s totally false,” said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. “There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.”

Dr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.

“Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,” Malůš said.

While he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.

Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.

“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you’ve come into the wrong place,” he said. “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.”

For those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.

“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,” he said. “Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself.”"," For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room.

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

16,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/25/sport/yaroslav-amosov-logan-storley-mma-bellator-spt-intl,"CNN —

One year and a day on from Russia’s invasion of his home country of Ukraine, Bellator MMA world champion Yaroslav Amosov won on his return to the cage as he defended his title.

Amosov’s welterweight bout against Britain’s Michael Page was originally scheduled for May 2022, but was postponed when he returned to Ukraine to help in the war effort.

Page then fought against American Logan Storley for the interim welterweight championship and lost, meaning Amosov fought Storley for the title at Bellator 291 in Dublin, Ireland on Saturday.

Amosov got a rapturous welcome when he walked to the cage wearing a yellow and blue t-shirt emblazoned with the words “Colors of Freedom” on it.

And he outclassed his US opponent throughout the evening, providing no areas of criticism as the judges all scored the fight in the Ukrainian’s favor.

Afterwards, draped in an Ukrainian flag, Amosov dedicated the victory to his home country.

“Ukrainian people, I love you. I love you my people,” Amosov said, with tears of emotion evident. “Please do not forget what is happening.”

Amosov’s involvement in the war first became widely known in April last year, when a video he posted of himself recovering his world championship belt from the rubble of his home in Irpin went viral.

“It’s a year since the big war started and for me it’s a big motivation because I understand what happened and what’s going on now in my country,” a visibly emotional Amosov said at Thursday’s press conference. “I understand that it’s been a very hard year for all Ukrainians.

“When the Russian soldiers left central Ukraine, I took my belt and many people – my friends, my team, manager and coach – told me: ‘You must go and defend your belt. Now, your work is as a mediator – you must win this fight, you must talk.’

“So I want to talk about this but it’s hard sometimes, for my country and me it’s hard, but I understand I must do this.”

Amosov is one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and, at 27-0, currently holds the longest active unbeaten streak in all of MMA, needing just three wins to equal Khabib Nurmagomedov’s all-time record of 29-0.

Speaking exclusively to CNN from Irpin in May, Amosov recounted the horror and devastation Vladimir Putin’s war has brought to his homeland. He described it as “destruction.”

Amosov had returned home from a training camp in Thailand four days before the war began. Once Russian troops began advancing, Amosov says he took his wife and six-month-old son to safety on the outskirts of Ukraine before joining the territorial defense to aid civilians in and around Irpin.

“It’s hard to look at your city that was once full of happiness, life,” Amosov told CNN at the time. “It was always very beautiful here, people were happy, they were happy with their life and took pleasure in it.

“Then simply to look at the city now, which is on fire, which is getting destroyed and it becomes horrible to look at. You couldn’t really go driving around the city because the roads were covered with trees, in some places, there were parts of houses. Destruction.”

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), at least 8,006 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 13,287 injured since the invasion began on February 24, 2022.

At least 487 children have been killed and 954 injured, but the OHCHR says the actual number of civilian casualties is “considerably higher” as reports of deaths and injuries in certain regions still cannot be corroborated."," One year and a day on from Russia’s invasion of his home country of Ukraine, Bellator MMA world champion Yaroslav Amosov won on his return to the cage as he defended his title.Amosov’s welterweight bout against Britain’s Michael Page was originally scheduled for May 2022, but was postponed when he returned to Ukraine to help in the war effort.Page then fought against American Logan Storley for the interim welterweight championship and lost, meaning Amosov fought Storley for the title at Bellator 291 in Dublin, Ireland on Saturday.Amosov got a rapturous welcome when he walked to the cage wearing a yellow and blue t-shirt emblazoned with the words “Colors of Freedom” on it.And he outclassed his US opponent throughout the evening, providing no areas of criticism as the judges all scored the fight in the Ukrainian’s favor.Afterwards, draped in an Ukrainian flag, Amosov dedicated the victory to his home country.“Ukrainian people, I love you. I love you my people,” Amosov said, with tears of emotion evident. “Please do not forget what is happening.”Amosov celebrates winning against Storley at Bellator 291. Evan Treacy/INPHO/ShutterstockAmosov’s involvement in the war first became widely known in April last year, when a video he posted of himself recovering his world championship belt from the rubble of his home in Irpin went viral.“It’s a year since the big war started and for me it’s a big motivation because I understand what happened and what’s going on now in my country,” a visibly emotional Amosov said at Thursday’s press conference. “I understand that it’s been a very hard year for all Ukrainians.“When the Russian soldiers left central Ukraine, I took my belt and many people – my friends, my team, manager and coach – told me: ‘You must go and defend your belt.

Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

“I was very nervous,” she tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells CNN Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.

It’s a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.

“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine."," Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.“I was very nervous,” she tells  Sport’s Amanda Davies.“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment.

Some parts of being a professional tennis player aren’t glamorous.

And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.

“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour? It must be so amazing!”

“Me: gets bagled on your birthday, sitting eating Doritos at midnight, waiting to get on a 16 hr flight home,” the American tweeted, alongside a selfie of her eating the crisps.

As well as reaching the semifinals in Dubai, Pegula reached the final of the Qatar Open last week, where she was defeated by the in-form Iga Swiatek.

“In all seriousness, “Pegula added in a follow-up tweet, “proud of my efforts the past two weeks. Time for some rest.”

Pegula has emerged as one of the top players on tour in the last two seasons, rising to a career high ranking in singles and doubles.

But, although the result on Friday didn’t go her way, at least she still celebrated her 29th birthday with Coco Gauff, the world No. 6.

“Our (mostly mine) terrible vocals of your birthday song,” Gauff tweeted in response. “But at least the cake was good.”"," Some parts of being a professional tennis player aren’t glamorous.And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour?

The Arizona Cardinals have hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon as their new head coach, just two days after the Eagles lost 38-35 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.

The announcement came just hours after the Eagles’ offensive coordinator Shane Steichen left his post to join the Indianapolis Colts as their head coach.

According to the Cardinals, Gannon signed a five-year deal.

“I am super excited about the opportunity,” Gannon said. “I look forward to getting my hands on the players and putting a winning product on the field.”

Gannon, 40, has 15 years of coaching experience, spending the last two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the Eagles which included the trip to Super Bowl LVII.

In his time in Philadelphia, Gannon overhauled the Eagles defense from a liability into one of the meanest units in the NFL. They improved from conceding 26.1 points per game in 2020 (20th in the league) to 20.2 in 2022 (eighth).

This past regular season, the Gannon-led defense led the NFL with 70 sacks – the third most sacks in a season as well as a finishing first in pass defense (171.6 yards per game).

Gannon will have to work his magic again if he is to turn around a Cardinals team that finished the season with a 4-13 record and finished the season ranked 31st for points allowed.

Arizona has the third overall pick in the upcoming NFL draft.

Despite the loss of both coordinators in less than 24 hours, the Eagles tweeted “thank you” to both former coordinators on Tuesday."," The Arizona Cardinals have hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon as their new head coach, just two days after the Eagles lost 38-35 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.The announcement came just hours after the Eagles’ offensive coordinator Shane Steichen left his post to join the Indianapolis Colts as their head coach.According to the Cardinals, Gannon signed a five-year deal.“I am super excited about the opportunity,” Gannon said. “I look forward to getting my hands on the players and putting a winning product on the field.”Gannon, 40, has 15 years of coaching experience, spending the last two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the Eagles which included the trip to Super Bowl LVII.In his time in Philadelphia, Gannon overhauled the Eagles defense from a liability into one of the meanest units in the NFL.

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."," It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.“This is just the beginning.

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

Tiger Woods played his best golf since the car crash in February 2021 that threatened to end his career to finish tied-45th at the Genesis Invitational, as Jon Rahm walked away with his third PGA Tour win of 2023 to regain the world No. 1 spot.

It was Woods’ first competitive outing since The Open Championship in July 2022 and his first non-major appearance since October 2020.

The 15-time major winner has played sparingly since sustaining serious leg injuries in the crash in Southern California, but shot his lowest single round score – 67 on Saturday – since the crash en route to finishing one-under-par for the tournament.

Following his final round, Woods said his goal from now on is to play the four majors every year, but he doesn’t expect “to play too much more than that.”

“My body and my leg and my back just won’t allow me to play much more than that anymore,” he told CBS. “So that was my goal last year and I was able to play three of the four, and this year, I can hopefully play all four. That is going to be my schedule going forward because of all of the limitations I have.

“My game is fine. Yeah, it is rusty. I made some silly mistakes here and there, and I didn’t quite pick up the speed of the greens each and every day fast enough, like I normally would if I was playing.

“But overall, I feel like I hit the ball like I have been hitting it at home. I just had to bring it out here where I had to walk from point A to point B and that was always the difficulty of it. I am just so thankful for all my team for getting me ready each and every night, morning, to at least give myself a chance to go out there and play. I was able to do it.”

Woods added that he expects to play the Masters in April, the first major of the year and a tournament he has won five times.

‘Best season of my life’

Meanwhile, Rahm continued his stunning form in 2023 to win the 10th PGA Tour title of his career and knock Scottie Scheffler off the top of the world rankings.

The Spaniard came through a nail-biting, final-round battle against Max Homa to win by two shots after posting a final score of 17-under-par, which included two birdies in his final five holes.

The victory marks Rahm’s fifth win in his last nine competitive starts as he continues to play perhaps the best golf of his career.

“That was a tough week and a tough Sunday,” Rahm told CBS. “Max battled out there and Patrick [Cantlay] gave us a scare, so I’m just glad I could come through at the end.

“I’ve never had three PGA Tour wins in a season and to do it this early on is incredible, and to do it at this golf course … I’ve won five out of my last nine starts, I haven’t finished worse than top seven and I’ve won three tournaments already.

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"," During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.“I loved playing rugby,” he tells  Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan.

Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”",,"New Zealand, Wales, France, Australia, Spain, New","Campbell Johnstone, Johnstone, Sport, Ruby Tui, Aaron Smith, Grant Robertson, Phil, Nigel Owens, Gareth Thomas, Owens, Thomas, Dan Palmer","All Blacks, Ospreys, Canterbury, Crusaders, All, Wales, US",Johnstone,"New, Zealand, Wales, France, Canterbury, Australia, Spain, US","Campbell, Johnstone, Ruby, Tui, Aaron, Smith, Grant, Robertson, Ospreys, Phil, Rees, /, ShutterstockOn, Biarritz, Nigel, Owens, Thomas, Dan, Palmer",

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

Upset

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."," After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.Krejčíková embraces Świątek after winning the final.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

Comas joins pitcher Solomon Bates, who came out as gay after being released in 2022 when he was a minor leaguer in the Giants organization, and former Brewers farmhand David Denson, who became the first openly gay active player in affiliated baseball in 2015."," Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches.

Tick tock, tick tock. The new MLB rules are coming fast at players; just ask Cal Conley.

The Atlanta Braves hitter looked as confused as everyone else on Saturday when the new pitch clock regulation sparked confusion during a spring training game between the Braves and the Boston Red Sox.

With the game tied at 6-6, Conley was sitting on a full count against Robert Kwiatkowski.

However, as the pitch clock hit eight seconds, umpire John Libka jumped in to award strike three with Conley not yet squared up to receive the delivery.

Confused by what had just happened, Conley appeared to jog towards first base thinking that it was Kwiatkowski who had received a time violation for taking too long to pitch his delivery.

“Me?” questioned a baffled Conley, pointing towards himself before it dawned on him that he was being penalized.

The new MLB rules state that hitters must be ready in the batter’s box with eight seconds remaining and Conley was not still going through his preparation at that point.

A league source confirmed to CNN that Libka made the correct call in the game.

With players, fans and coaching staff inside the CoolToday Park all looking confused, the game ended in a 6-6 draw in a chorus of boos.

For Braves manager Brian Snitker, the incident was a reminder that players must instantly adapt to the new rules.

“These are the kind of things that tell you why we’re starting this right now,” he told reporters.

“You never know what might happen. That instance right there shows you what could happen.”

Speeding things up

The new MLB rules are designed to speed up play, with baseball games taking an average of more than three hours to finish.

They dictate that pitchers have 15 seconds to complete a delivery with bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on bases. In addition, batters will be limited to one timeout per plate appearance, and there will also be a 30-second timer between hitters.

New regulations also mean the size of the three bases have grown from 15 inches to 18 inches in the hope of reducing injuries.

If the new rules for the 2023 season are going to usher in a new, faster era for the sport, then it looks likely that players are going to need time to adapt.

However, the changes are being welcomed by some.

“If this is going to be the pace of these games, I’m OK with it,” Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “First look, so far, so good.”

Teams have the remaining of the preseason to make mistakes before more is at stake when the season starts for real on March 30. Tick tock, tick tock."," Tick tock, tick tock.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to win and hard liquor such as wine, vodka, and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.

“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour? It must be so amazing!”

“Me: gets bagled on your birthday, sitting eating Doritos at midnight, waiting to get on a 16 hr flight home,” the American tweeted, alongside a selfie of her eating the crisps.

“In all seriousness, “Pegula added in a follow-up tweet, “proud of my efforts the past two weeks. Time for some rest.”

Pegula has emerged as one of the top players on tour in the last two seasons, rising to a career high ranking in singles and doubles.

But, although the result on Friday didn’t go her way, at least she still celebrated her 29th birthday with Coco Gauff, the world No. 6.

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."," It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.“This is just the beginning.

Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

“I was very nervous,” she tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells CNN Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.

It’s a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.

“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine."," Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.“I was very nervous,” she tells  Sport’s Amanda Davies.“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment.

For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

When the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a “darkness retreat,” many were left scratching their heads.

“It’s just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,” Rodgers said earlier this month. “We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I’m really looking forward to it.”

Rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done “many meditation and yoga retreats” in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices “that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.”

But what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?

What happens in the dark

A darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats, nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.

The cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark. Sky Cave Retreats

“The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,” said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.

“When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy – they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,” Berman said. “In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful – whether it’s love, forgiveness, peace – and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.”

The center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark – earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time – the doors are never locked – and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn’t flipped on by accident.

The cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person’s needs.

Participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.

Burak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.

“It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,” said Dalcik. “There’s nothing New Age about this – it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can’t, you should probably get pretty curious about why.”

Berman cautions the retreat isn’t for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one’s troubles.

“It’s not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience – it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,” Berman said. “But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There’s an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they’re no longer resisting that part of themselves.”

A therapeutic tool or junk science?

For now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.

“That’s totally false,” said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. “There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.”

Dr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.

“Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,” Malůš said.

While he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.

Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.

“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you’ve come into the wrong place,” he said. “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.”

For those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.

“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,” he said. “Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself.”"," For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room.

Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.“If somebody’s coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you’ve come into the wrong place,” he said. “But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.”For those who aren’t able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.“It’s about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,” he said. “Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what’s actually happening within yourself.”",Southern Oregon,"Arlington, Virginia, Turkey, Medicine, Malůš, Ostrava","Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers, Rodgers, Sky Cave Retreats, Klamath, Sky, Scott Berman, Jill, Berman, Dalcik, David Blask, Marek, Malůš","Rodgers, NFL, darkA, Cave Retreats, Hobbit, Cave, New Age, Laboratory, Tulane University School, University, Czech, DMT","NFL,Sky,Cave,Retreats“The,Retreats,fame,Hobbit,RetreatsBurak,Dalcik,Chrono,-,Neuroendocrine,Oncology,at,Tulane,University,School,of,Medicine,the,Ostrava,Malůš","Arlington, Virginia, Turkey, the, Czech, Republic","Aaron, Rodgers, Sky, Cave, Retreats, Klamath, Falls, Scott, Berman, Jill, David, Blask","Green, Bay, Packers, Southern, Oregon"

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

Paris Saint-Germain took control of the title race in Ligue 1 on Sunday with a huge 3-0 win away at bitter rival Marseille to extend its lead at the top of the table to eight points.

It was a masterclass in attacking football from Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi, who combined for all three of PSG’s goals and reached individual milestones in the process.

Messi scored the 700th club goal of his career, a number matched only by Cristiano Ronaldo, while Mbappé become PSG’s joint-record scorer with his 200th goal for the club.

Mbappé reached his second century of goals in just 246 games, per Opta, 55 games less than Edinson Cavani took to reach the landmark.

“He is the best striker in the world, that’s for sure, because he plays with speed and everything he does he does quickly,” PSG head coach Christophe Galtier told reporters.

“He does it with great intensity and he knows how to be present in big matches, that’s also the sign of a great player.”

Marseille had got the better of PSG earlier this month, knocking the Parisians out of the French Cup, and started Sunday’s game the better of the two teams.

However, unable to take advantage of its early dominance, Marseille paid the price as a rampant PSG took control of the match.

Messi and Mbappé both scored and assisted a goal to give PSG a comfortable 2-0 lead at half time, though Marseille will have gone into the break relieved it wasn’t at least five goals down.

Mbappé then scored the pick of the goals 10 minutes into the second half to end the match as a contest, running onto Messi’s scooped through ball and volleying first time into the bottom corner.

Despite a flurry of late action from Marseille, there was to be no comeback in Le Classique as PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma produced a couple of fine saves to give the team its first clean sheet since a 7-0 victory over sixth-tier Pays de Cassel in January.

However, it wasn’t all good news for PSG as defender Presnel Kimpembe was stretchered off early in the first half with what Galtier later confirmed was a ruptured Achilles tendon.

Galtier was involved in an angry confrontation with some Marseille fans behind the PSG dugout at full time, having to be dragged away by the rest of his coaching staff.

Manchester United won its first trophy since 2017 with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United to win the Carabao Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.

Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.

Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German’s despairing fingertips – it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.

The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.

“It’s an amazing feeling, we’ve been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,” Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.

“It’s been an amazing period. The first trophy of the season but we want more. It’s not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards deserve more.”

Turnaround

It was a final longtime coming for both teams for different reasons.

For Manchester United, the club hasn’t won a trophy since 2017; a cataclysmic expanse for the club the size of it.

In the black and white of Newcastle, it is an even longer wait, having not won any major silverware for 54 years.

It is also the first final for the club since its controversial takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2021.

The PIF – which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium – is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

With thousands of fans having made the journey down to London from Newcastle for the final, Wembley’s atmosphere had a proper cup final feel to it.

And to the delight of Manchester United fans, their local hero and the team’s man in form, Rashford, was declared fit to start despite a recent injury scare. Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.

In the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.

When it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.

The Brazilian midfielder was signed by manager Ten Hag in a £60 million ($73m) deal from Real Madrid in the summer and his impact as the heart of the team has been indicative of Manchester United’s rise since Ten Hag’s arrival at the club.

Things went from bad to worse for Newcastle minutes later when some neat link up play between Rashford and Wout Weghorst saw the England star played into the opposition’s box. Although he was able to get away a left-footed shot under pressure from Botman, Rashford’s shot looked to have been heading wide meaning the goal was credited to the Netherlands defender.

After the halftime break, Newcastle ramped up its pressure on David de Gea’s goal, with Saint-Maximin and the newly-introduced Alexander Isak doing their best to fashion goalscoring opportunities.

The final two minutes were filled with set pieces, substitutions and breakaway chances – with Manchester United actually looking the most likely to score.

In the dying seconds, with the result seemingly wrapped up, Portugal international Fernandes had a glorious opportunity to cap off a memorable afternoon, only for Karius to produce a smart stop.

In the end, Manchester United was able to run down the remainder of the clock, end its six-year trophy wait – the club’s longest wait for a major trophy since 1983 – and possibly usher in a new era at the club.

“It’s a mixture of all the emotions. It’s massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it’s something we’ve missed as a club,” Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.

“The fact we’ve come all this way and won it, it’s a massive feeling. Hopefully it pushes us now to keep going. There’s hunger to add more finals like this. I’ve been in finals where we’ve won and lost. It’s massive for us as a club and individuals and it’s part of our history. We want to keep adding to that.”

He added: “We want to be involved in a lot of games and that means we’ve got to stay in the competitions. If we want to win things, we have to keep pushing.”

For Newcastle, it was yet more disappointment at Wembley as it has now lost each of its last nine matches at the stadium, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final, extending what is the longest ever losing run by a club side at the venue."," Manchester United won its first trophy since 2017 with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United to win the Carabao Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German’s despairing fingertips – it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.“It’s an amazing feeling, we’ve been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,” Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.“It’s been an amazing period.

YouTuber Jake Paul suffered the first defeat of his fledgling boxing career on Sunday night as pro boxer-turned reality TV star Tommy Fury edged him out in a split decision in Saudi Arabia.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh.

“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said after the fight. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show “Love Island.”

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted – Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent’s head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that’s often only allowed for short periods of time.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury’s favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday’s fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

“All respect to Tommy, he won, don’t judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I’ll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,” Paul said after the fight.

Paul only began boxing in 2018, but had since gone on to record six wins prior to Sunday – including four knockouts.

12,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/23/sport/campbell-johnstone-all-blacks-rugby-spt-intl,"CNN —

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"," During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.“I loved playing rugby,” he tells  Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France. Phil Rees/ShutterstockOn top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”",,"New Zealand, Wales, France, Australia, Spain, New","Campbell Johnstone, Johnstone, Sport, Ruby Tui, Aaron Smith, Grant Robertson, Phil, Nigel Owens, Gareth Thomas, Owens, Thomas, Dan Palmer","All Blacks, Ospreys, Canterbury, Crusaders, All, Wales, US",Johnstone,"New, Zealand, Wales, France, Canterbury, Australia, Spain, US","Campbell, Johnstone, Ruby, Tui, Aaron, Smith, Grant, Robertson, Ospreys, Phil, Rees, /, ShutterstockOn, Biarritz, Nigel, Owens, Thomas, Dan, Palmer",

Australia won the Women’s T20 World Cup in brilliant fashion, defeating home side South Africa by 19 runs in front of a sold out Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town on Saturday

Victory once again underlined Australia’s dominance in the sport, as the team completed a repeat three-peat under captain Meg Lanning and won the tournament for the sixth time in seven editions.

“It is a pretty special effort from the group,” Lanning told Sky Sports afterwards.

“We felt we had a good score and felt confident if we could hit our areas. We set the tone in an excellent powerplay. We have a special group, not just the players but also the support staff.”

After Lanning won the toss and elected to bat first, the Australian openers, Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney, navigated their way through the first few overs as the home crowd urged on the South African attack.

Healy fell in the fifth over, caught by Nadine de Klerk off Marizanne Kapp’s bowling, but Mooney stayed at the crease for an impressive unbeaten 74 off just 53 balls.

She showcased her full range of shots during her innings, anchoring her side’s score, as frugal South African bowling largely restricted the Australians from posting a sizeable score.

Ash Gardner, who was named player of the tournament, contributed an important cameo of 29 off 21 balls while Mooney’s 11 runs in the last over helped Australia to a respectable 156-6.

It seemed an achievable, if tricky, target for South Africa to reach but a slow start left them 22/1 after six overs and with too much ground to claw back.

Although South Africa accelerated late on, led by Laura Wolvaardt’s 61 from 48 balls, accurate bowling and crisp fielding stifled any comeback and secured Australia’s victory."," Australia won the Women’s T20 World Cup in brilliant fashion, defeating home side South Africa by 19 runs in front of a sold out Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town on SaturdayVictory once again underlined Australia’s dominance in the sport, as the team completed a repeat three-peat under captain Meg Lanning and won the tournament for the sixth time in seven editions.“It is a pretty special effort from the group,” Lanning told Sky Sports afterwards.“We felt we had a good score and felt confident if we could hit our areas.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

In a show of support for children impacted by the earthquake in Turkey, soccer fans threw stuffed animals onto the pitch during a match between Beşiktaş and Antalyaspor on Sunday.

The game stopped at four minutes and 17 seconds to correspond with the time the earthquake struck southeastern Turkey – 4:17 a.m. local time on February 6.

Fans showered the stadium with teddy bears and other stuffed toys of all colors and sizes during the match at Vodafone Park.

These will be sent by Beşiktaş to children impacted by the earthquake, which has killed about 50,000 people across Turkey and Syria.

Players rushed to collect the stuffed animals while the scoreboard screen flashed with the license plate numbers of the eleven Turkish provinces impacted by the earthquake.

Some Besiktas fans also chanted “government resign” in protest against the official response to the disaster, viewed by many in Turkey as being slow and insufficient.

In some areas, people complained that there were no organized relief efforts and that scores of bodies were slow to be collected, causing the stench of death to spread.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s partner in government, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) head Devlet Bahçeli, called for soccer games to be played without fans and ended his Beşiktaş membership in light of the anti-government chants.

The Arizona Cardinals have hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon as their new head coach, just two days after the Eagles lost 38-35 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.

The announcement came just hours after the Eagles’ offensive coordinator Shane Steichen left his post to join the Indianapolis Colts as their head coach.

According to the Cardinals, Gannon signed a five-year deal.

“I am super excited about the opportunity,” Gannon said. “I look forward to getting my hands on the players and putting a winning product on the field.”

Gannon, 40, has 15 years of coaching experience, spending the last two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the Eagles which included the trip to Super Bowl LVII.

In his time in Philadelphia, Gannon overhauled the Eagles defense from a liability into one of the meanest units in the NFL. They improved from conceding 26.1 points per game in 2020 (20th in the league) to 20.2 in 2022 (eighth).

This past regular season, the Gannon-led defense led the NFL with 70 sacks – the third most sacks in a season as well as a finishing first in pass defense (171.6 yards per game).

Gannon will have to work his magic again if he is to turn around a Cardinals team that finished the season with a 4-13 record and finished the season ranked 31st for points allowed.

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

Gao meng/Imaginechina/APDabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.Infrastructure projectsThe football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022. Alaa Badarneh/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockGeneral Secretary of the PFA Hilal told  Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”Coach Daboub goes even further.“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said.","West Bank,Gaza City,East Jerusalem,Gaza Strip,Gaza,West,West Asian","Palestinian, Palestine, Portugal, African, Middle East, Israel, Palestinians, Palestianian, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, United, Arabic, Israeli, Tubas, Nablus, Hamas, Jerusalem, Japan, United States, Singapore, Canaan, Tunisian, Egyptian, Entry, Asian, Egypt, Qatar, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Spanish, Ramallah, Portuguese, North Korea, Jiangyin, China, Gao, European, Arouca, Belgian, Bethlehem, Tel Aviv, Asia","Arab, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Nakba, Arab Emirates, Ulrik, Rami Hamadeh, Ahmed Daraghmeh, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud Sarsak, Mahmud, Sarsak, Mongolia, Jabal, Bnei, Jibril Rajoub, Henley, Suhaib, Makram Daboub, Daboub, Arab Cup, Gianni Infantino, Ismail El Haddad, Yaser Hamed, Hamed, Spain, Thomas Bach, Issam, Rajoub, Firas Abu Hilal, Shaheen, Shaheen., Sports, Dabbagh, Song Kum Song, Jiangsu, Portugal, Alaa, Hilal., Abu, Morocco","Qatar, Atlas Lions, Hamadeh, Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, AFC Asian, IDF, Reuters, Islamic Jihad, Philippines, IDs, PFA, AP, Partners, FIFA, AFC, WAFF, FA Jibril, IOC, General, National, projectsThe, IFA, Futsal Hall, Faisal, Palestine, PFA Hilal, UEFA","the,Atlas,Lions,AFC,Asian,Cup,Tubas,Israel,Defense,Forces,IDF,Reuters,Hamas,Al,-,Shifa,Islamic,Jihad,Palestinian,Football,Association,AP,Henley,&,Partners,FIFA,Suhaib,Salem,ReutersThe,Visa,The,Confederation,West,Federation,WAFF,IOC,Issam,Rimawi,/,Anadolu,Agency,Getty,ImagesThe,PFA,National,Olympic,Committee,“To,Oday,Dabbagh,F.C.,Arouca,R.,Charleroi,S.C,’s,IFA,FIFA.They,Palestine,Ram,Hilal,football,association,UEFA,World,Cup,”Coach,Daboub","Qatar, Portugal, Israel, the, West, Bank, Gaza, East, Jerusalem, Abu, Dhabi, United, Arab, Emirates, Nablus, City, Philippines, Mongolia, Yemen, Strip, London, Japan, States, forfeit, Singapore, Daboub, The, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi, Arabia, Spain, Palestine, Ramallah, North, Korea, Jiangyin, city, China, Jiangsu, Bethlehem, Tel, Aviv, boycotts, Asian, Cups","Rami, Hamadeh, Jordan, Ulrik, Pedersen, /, CSM, Zuma, Sports, Ahmed, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud, Sarsak, Mahmud, Hams, AFP, Getty, ImagesPalestinian, Jabal, Al, -, Mukaber, Bnei, Sakhnin, Gazan, Makram, Daboub, Gianni, Infantino, Ismail, El, Haddad, Yaser, Hamed, Thomas, Bach, Firas, Abu, Hilal, Diala, Shaheen, Song, Kum, Gao, meng, Imaginechina, APDabbagh, Faisal, Husseini, Stadium, Jibril, Rajoub, Alaa, Badarneh","the, Middle, East, Asia"

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

Tiger Woods played his best golf since the car crash in February 2021 that threatened to end his career to finish tied-45th at the Genesis Invitational, as Jon Rahm walked away with his third PGA Tour win of 2023 to regain the world No. 1 spot.

It was Woods’ first competitive outing since The Open Championship in July 2022 and his first non-major appearance since October 2020.

The 15-time major winner has played sparingly since sustaining serious leg injuries in the crash in Southern California, but shot his lowest single round score – 67 on Saturday – since the crash en route to finishing one-under-par for the tournament.

Following his final round, Woods said his goal from now on is to play the four majors every year, but he doesn’t expect “to play too much more than that.”

“My body and my leg and my back just won’t allow me to play much more than that anymore,” he told CBS. “So that was my goal last year and I was able to play three of the four, and this year, I can hopefully play all four. That is going to be my schedule going forward because of all of the limitations I have.

Rahm won his fifth tournament in his last nine starts. Michael Owens/Getty Images

“My game is fine. Yeah, it is rusty. I made some silly mistakes here and there, and I didn’t quite pick up the speed of the greens each and every day fast enough, like I normally would if I was playing.

“But overall, I feel like I hit the ball like I have been hitting it at home. I just had to bring it out here where I had to walk from point A to point B and that was always the difficulty of it. I am just so thankful for all my team for getting me ready each and every night, morning, to at least give myself a chance to go out there and play. I was able to do it.”

Woods added that he expects to play the Masters in April, the first major of the year and a tournament he has won five times.

‘Best season of my life’

Meanwhile, Rahm continued his stunning form in 2023 to win the 10th PGA Tour title of his career and knock Scottie Scheffler off the top of the world rankings.

The Spaniard came through a nail-biting, final-round battle against Max Homa to win by two shots after posting a final score of 17-under-par, which included two birdies in his final five holes.

The victory marks Rahm’s fifth win in his last nine competitive starts as he continues to play perhaps the best golf of his career.

“That was a tough week and a tough Sunday,” Rahm told CBS. “Max battled out there and Patrick [Cantlay] gave us a scare, so I’m just glad I could come through at the end.

“I’ve never had three PGA Tour wins in a season and to do it this early on is incredible, and to do it at this golf course … I’ve won five out of my last nine starts, I haven’t finished worse than top seven and I’ve won three tournaments already.

22,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,"CNN —

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016. Apple TV+

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association. Apple TV+

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"," Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells  Sports.Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust.

Apple TV+Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association. Apple TV+The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League. Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesIt epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.‘The war for football rages on’Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA. Apple TV+For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told ’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over.

There have been a lot of dull outfits on the fairways over the years – monochrome colors, polo shirts, and plain caps galore. Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart’s sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA’s 1999 Ryder Cup outfit – so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

Some looks became a signature. Head to toe in fluorescent orange? Had to be Rickie Fowler. Cowboy hat and belt? Shingo Katayama was in town. And for absolutely everything in between, the unmatched John Daly – perhaps the only golfer in history you could bank on to make the fashion statement at whichever event he was playing that week.

A prominent human rights group has written to Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali to raise serious concerns over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

The new season gets underway in Bahrain on March 5, ahead of which the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) has urged F1 and the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, not to “sportswash the blood-soaked images” of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, which hosts a race on March 19.

“Sportswashing” refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.

“Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.

“F1 must establish an independent and impartial inquiry to examine the role of their races in human rights violations, and the FIA must adopt a human rights policy consistent with UN principles.

“Failure to do so will allow their sport to continue to be used to repair the reputation of brutal dictators.”

In response to BIRD, an F1 spokesperson in a statement to CNN: “For decades Formula 1 has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.

“Sports like Formula 1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement.

“We take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”

The FIA, motorsport’s governing body told CNN it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.”

“The FIA, as is the case with other international sporting federations, cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” said an FIA spokesperson in a statement on Monday.

“This independence from the affairs of states, as underlined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), does not mean however that we are insensitive to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned.

“At the pinnacle of motor sport, F1 events take place across a huge spectrum of different countries and cultures around the world,” added the FIA statement.

“It is our belief that the most fundamental goal of motor sport, and all sport, is founded on the desire to increase our common ground and cultivate the principles of cooperation and commonality between people.

“The FIA will continue to work on projects that bring positive benefits to the wider society, acting always within its scope as the regulator of world motor sport,” the federation added.

CNN has reached out to the Bahrain Supreme Council for Youth and Sports and the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Sport for comment.

This is not the first time that F1 has come under the spotlight for hosting races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

In 2020, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said the sport has a “massive issue” with human rights ahead of competing in Bahrain.

But speaking to CNN Sports days after Hamilton’s comments, former F1 CEO Chase Carey said the sport has been “very clear about our commitment to human rights” and is “very proud of our partnership here in Bahrain.”"," A prominent human rights group has written to Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali to raise serious concerns over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.The new season gets underway in Bahrain on March 5, ahead of which the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) has urged F1 and the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, not to “sportswash the blood-soaked images” of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, which hosts a race on March 19.“Sportswashing” refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.“Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.“F1 must establish an independent and impartial inquiry to examine the role of their races in human rights violations, and the FIA must adopt a human rights policy consistent with UN principles.“Failure to do so will allow their sport to continue to be used to repair the reputation of brutal dictators.”In response to BIRD, an F1 spokesperson in a statement to : “For decades Formula 1 has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.“Sports like Formula 1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement.“We take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”The FIA, motorsport’s governing body told  it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.”“The FIA, as is the case with other international sporting federations, cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” said an FIA spokesperson in a statement on Monday.“This independence from the affairs of states, as underlined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), does not mean however that we are insensitive to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned.“At the pinnacle of motor sport, F1 events take place across a huge spectrum of different countries and cultures around the world,” added the FIA statement.“It is our belief that the most fundamental goal of motor sport, and all sport, is founded on the desire to increase our common ground and cultivate the principles of cooperation and commonality between people.“The FIA will continue to work on projects that bring positive benefits to the wider society, acting always within its scope as the regulator of world motor sport,” the federation added. has reached out to the Bahrain Supreme Council for Youth and Sports and the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Sport for comment.This is not the first time that F1 has come under the spotlight for hosting races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.In 2020, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said the sport has a “massive issue” with human rights ahead of competing in Bahrain.But speaking to  Sports days after Hamilton’s comments, former F1 CEO Chase Carey said the sport has been “very clear about our commitment to human rights” and is “very proud of our partnership here in Bahrain.”",,"Bahrain, Democracy, Saudi Arabia, F1, Youth, Saudi, Sport, Sports","Formula One, Stefano Domenicali, Ahmed Alwadaei, Advocacy Director, Sports, Arabia Ministry, F1, Lewis Hamilton, Hamilton, Carey","Bahrain Grand, Bahrain Institute, Rights, BIRD, FIA, UN, Formula, International, IOC, Bahrain Supreme Council","Formula,One,CEO,Stefano,the,Bahrain,Institute,for,Rights,and,Democracy,(,BIRD,FIA,UN,International,Olympic,Committee,Supreme,Council,Youth,Sports,Saudi,Arabia,Ministry,of,Sport","Bahrain, Saudi, Arabia","F1, Sayed, Ahmed, Alwadaei, Advocacy, Director, Lewis, Hamilton, Chase, Carey",

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart.

Shirtless and mud-spattered – golf fans tuning in to the Honda Classic on Saturday would have been forgiven for thinking they’d switched over to the wrong channel.

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

Almost knee deep in the mud, this time it was shirt and shoes off for Buhai. Unfortunately, he could not repeat his earlier escape effort, as his first attempt barely moved a yard.

Buhai eventually tapped in for another painful double bogey, later carding a four-over par 74 for the round, yet the American was cheered back to the clubhouse by fans.

“A lot of claps. Makes you feel good,” Buhai told reporters. “I feel like my body looks good, and hopefully on TV it makes it look a little bigger.

“It was amazing. This is a pretty new experience for me. Just having a lot of fans. It’s funny, [playing partner] Dylan [Frittelli] was saying, ‘Are you from here? Like how much are you paying these guys to say your name?’ And it’s just really cool because I take a lot of pride.

“It brings warmth to my heart when people are shouting my name, cheering me on. It’s really just a fun experience, and I hope to have more of it.”

A final day 69 saw Bhatia finish tied 49th, 13 shots behind champion Chris Kirk. Having secured victory on his first start as a Korn Ferry Tour member at the Bahamas Great Exuma Classic in January 2022 and making the cut on his major debut at the US Open the previous year, Bhatia already has several career highlights.

Yet his bizarre experience in Florida has him keeping his options open, according to his most recent Instagram post.

He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.

An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.

And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.

He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.

As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.

Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.

Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.

Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.

The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.

During the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: “Fkn sucks!!!!”

Just another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s play-in tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday’s win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our a*s.”

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in – James’ injury permitting.

Who knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method."," The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.During the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup.

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/Netflix

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart.

She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/NetflixWhether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”",Western Front,"Scotland, Germany, Bäumer, Russian, Ukraine, German, French, Costa Rica, Birmingham, Alabama, Scottish, California","Lesley Paterson, Paterson, Erich Maria Remarque, Paul Bäumer, Reiner, Quiet, Ian Stokell, Netflix, Great Britain, Kevin, Sam Mendes, Edward Berger, Malte Grunert","First, Scottish Highlands, Armistice Talks, BAFTA, Oscars, XTERRA","BAFTA,XTERRA","Scotland, Germany, Ukraine, Hollywood, Netflix, Costa, Rica, Great, Britain, Birmingham, Alabama, California","Lesley, Paterson, Oscar, Erich, Maria, Remarque, ’s, Paul, Bäumer, Felix, Kammerer, Reiner, Bajo, /, NetflixFirst, Ian, Stokell, Kevin, C., Cox, Getty, NetflixWhether, Sam, Mendes, Edward, Berger, Malte, Grunert",

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over.

4,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"CNN —

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh.

Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty ImagesPalestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.Identification cardsHamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners.

But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.In a statement to , a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesA long roadTensions started to emerge in 2019.A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible.

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"," During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.“I loved playing rugby,” he tells  Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan.

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

9,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/25/football/alyssa-thompson-nwsl-draft-world-cup-spt-intl,"CNN —

Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

“I was very nervous,” she tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells CNN Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.

It’s a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.

“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine."," Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.“I was very nervous,” she tells  Sport’s Amanda Davies.“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.Alyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.Inspiring on and off the fieldThompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.Despite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells  Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.Alyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off. Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesThe pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.Despite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.It’s a tall order for the young striker.

There have been a lot of dull outfits on the fairways over the years – monochrome colors, polo shirts, and plain caps galore. Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart’s sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA’s 1999 Ryder Cup outfit – so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

Some looks became a signature. Head to toe in fluorescent orange? Had to be Rickie Fowler. Cowboy hat and belt? Shingo Katayama was in town. And for absolutely everything in between, the unmatched John Daly – perhaps the only golfer in history you could bank on to make the fashion statement at whichever event he was playing that week.

He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.

An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.

And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

🚨 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐃 𝐃𝐔 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐃𝐄 ! 🌎



🤩 Phénoménal ! 🇸🇪 Armand Duplantis est sur le toit du monde à Clermont-Ferrand en s'élevant à 6️⃣,2️⃣2️⃣ m !

Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.

He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.

As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.

Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.

Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.

Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.

It was the 60th time Duplantis has jumped clear of six meters or higher as he continues his dominant career.

Ukrainian pole vault legend Sergey Bubka was the first man to surpass the six meter mark when he did so in 1985. He held the world record until Lavillenie outjumped his mark in an event in Bubka’s home city of Donetsk which had him in attendance."," He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.🚨 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐃 𝐃𝐔 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐃𝐄 ! 🌎🤩 Phénoménal ! 🇸🇪 Armand Duplantis est sur le toit du monde à Clermont-Ferrand en s'élevant à 6️⃣,2️⃣2️⃣ m !Il faudra bientôt relever le plafond ! 😱📺 Revivez le @AllStarPerche en 𝗥𝗘𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬 sur https://t.co/xgXE6U6Tof pic.twitter.com/ihgsZ81aoh  FFAthlétisme (@FFAthletisme) February 25, 2023Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.Duplantis (right) celebrates after setting a new pole vault world record with Lavillenie (left).

Some parts of being a professional tennis player aren’t glamorous.

And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.

“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour? It must be so amazing!”

“Me: gets bagled on your birthday, sitting eating Doritos at midnight, waiting to get on a 16 hr flight home,” the American tweeted, alongside a selfie of her eating the crisps.

As well as reaching the semifinals in Dubai, Pegula reached the final of the Qatar Open last week, where she was defeated by the in-form Iga Swiatek.

“In all seriousness, “Pegula added in a follow-up tweet, “proud of my efforts the past two weeks. Time for some rest.”

Pegula has emerged as one of the top players on tour in the last two seasons, rising to a career high ranking in singles and doubles.

But, although the result on Friday didn’t go her way, at least she still celebrated her 29th birthday with Coco Gauff, the world No. 6.

“Our (mostly mine) terrible vocals of your birthday song,” Gauff tweeted in response. “But at least the cake was good.”"," Some parts of being a professional tennis player aren’t glamorous.And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour?

French judicial authorities have opened an investigation for rape into Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi, a source close to the investigation confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

The Nanterre prosecutor’s office, just outside of Paris, is leading the investigation, the source added.

Spanish-born Moroccan Hakimi is a full-back for Paris Saint-Germain and plays for the Moroccan national side. He scored the penalty kick that took Morocco to the World Cup semifinals during Qatar 2022.

“The Nanterre prosecutor’s office does not wish to comment on this ongoing investigation, as the information already published jeopardizes the inquiries necessary for finding the truth,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN.

CNN has reached out to Hakimi and PSG for comment.

Hakimi, who is considered one of the best defenders in the world, joined PSG from Inter Milan in 2021. He now plays alongside superstars such as Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé.

Due to his impressive performances at both club and international levels last year, the 24-year-old was named in the men’s best XI at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday."," French judicial authorities have opened an investigation for rape into Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi, a source close to the investigation confirmed to  on Tuesday.The Nanterre prosecutor’s office, just outside of Paris, is leading the investigation, the source added.Spanish-born Moroccan Hakimi is a full-back for Paris Saint-Germain and plays for the Moroccan national side.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

Upset

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."," After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.Krejčíková embraces Świątek after winning the final.

Embattled French Football Federation (FFF) president Noël Le Graët has resigned, the federation announced in a statement on Tuesday.

“Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.

It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”

FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.

Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.

Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”

According to Reuters, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport.

Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported. CNN has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment.

Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.

In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.

He later apologized to Zidane for the remarks.

Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.

But he also has a record of making controversial comments, saying in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.

“I would not stop the games. I do not want to be held hostage on homophobia. There are security services to ensure that these banners disappear,” Le Graët told radio station France Info at the time."," Embattled French Football Federation (FFF) president Noël Le Graët has resigned, the federation announced in a statement on Tuesday.“Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”According to Reuters, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport.Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported.  has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment.Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.He later apologized to Zidane for the remarks.Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.But he also has a record of making controversial comments, saying in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.“I would not stop the games.

A prominent human rights group has written to Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali to raise serious concerns over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

The new season gets underway in Bahrain on March 5, ahead of which the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) has urged F1 and the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, not to “sportswash the blood-soaked images” of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, which hosts a race on March 19.

“Sportswashing” refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.

“Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.

“F1 must establish an independent and impartial inquiry to examine the role of their races in human rights violations, and the FIA must adopt a human rights policy consistent with UN principles.

“Failure to do so will allow their sport to continue to be used to repair the reputation of brutal dictators.”

In response to BIRD, an F1 spokesperson in a statement to CNN: “For decades Formula 1 has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.

“Sports like Formula 1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement.

“We take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”

The FIA, motorsport’s governing body told CNN it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.”

“The FIA, as is the case with other international sporting federations, cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” said an FIA spokesperson in a statement on Monday.

“This independence from the affairs of states, as underlined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), does not mean however that we are insensitive to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned.

“At the pinnacle of motor sport, F1 events take place across a huge spectrum of different countries and cultures around the world,” added the FIA statement.

“It is our belief that the most fundamental goal of motor sport, and all sport, is founded on the desire to increase our common ground and cultivate the principles of cooperation and commonality between people.

“The FIA will continue to work on projects that bring positive benefits to the wider society, acting always within its scope as the regulator of world motor sport,” the federation added.

CNN has reached out to the Bahrain Supreme Council for Youth and Sports and the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Sport for comment.

This is not the first time that F1 has come under the spotlight for hosting races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

In 2020, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said the sport has a “massive issue” with human rights ahead of competing in Bahrain.

But speaking to CNN Sports days after Hamilton’s comments, former F1 CEO Chase Carey said the sport has been “very clear about our commitment to human rights” and is “very proud of our partnership here in Bahrain.”"," A prominent human rights group has written to Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali to raise serious concerns over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.The new season gets underway in Bahrain on March 5, ahead of which the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) has urged F1 and the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, not to “sportswash the blood-soaked images” of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, which hosts a race on March 19.“Sportswashing” refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.“Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.“F1 must establish an independent and impartial inquiry to examine the role of their races in human rights violations, and the FIA must adopt a human rights policy consistent with UN principles.“Failure to do so will allow their sport to continue to be used to repair the reputation of brutal dictators.”In response to BIRD, an F1 spokesperson in a statement to : “For decades Formula 1 has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.“Sports like Formula 1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement.“We take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”The FIA, motorsport’s governing body told  it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.”“The FIA, as is the case with other international sporting federations, cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” said an FIA spokesperson in a statement on Monday.“This independence from the affairs of states, as underlined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), does not mean however that we are insensitive to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned.“At the pinnacle of motor sport, F1 events take place across a huge spectrum of different countries and cultures around the world,” added the FIA statement.“It is our belief that the most fundamental goal of motor sport, and all sport, is founded on the desire to increase our common ground and cultivate the principles of cooperation and commonality between people.“The FIA will continue to work on projects that bring positive benefits to the wider society, acting always within its scope as the regulator of world motor sport,” the federation added. has reached out to the Bahrain Supreme Council for Youth and Sports and the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Sport for comment.This is not the first time that F1 has come under the spotlight for hosting races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.In 2020, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said the sport has a “massive issue” with human rights ahead of competing in Bahrain.But speaking to  Sports days after Hamilton’s comments, former F1 CEO Chase Carey said the sport has been “very clear about our commitment to human rights” and is “very proud of our partnership here in Bahrain.”",,"Bahrain, Democracy, Saudi Arabia, F1, Youth, Saudi, Sport, Sports","Formula One, Stefano Domenicali, Ahmed Alwadaei, Advocacy Director, Sports, Arabia Ministry, F1, Lewis Hamilton, Hamilton, Carey","Bahrain Grand, Bahrain Institute, Rights, BIRD, FIA, UN, Formula, International, IOC, Bahrain Supreme Council","Formula,One,CEO,Stefano,the,Bahrain,Institute,for,Rights,and,Democracy,(,BIRD,FIA,UN,International,Olympic,Committee,Supreme,Council,Youth,Sports,Saudi,Arabia,Ministry,of,Sport","Bahrain, Saudi, Arabia","F1, Sayed, Ahmed, Alwadaei, Advocacy, Director, Lewis, Hamilton, Chase, Carey",

Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he “would love to give the storybook ending” to Damar Hamlin’s recovery from a cardiac arrest, but admitted it’s still unclear whether the 24-year-old would play again.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.

The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin’s heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.

On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is “doing great” as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.

“If he’s able to get full clearance and he feels he’s ready to do it, that’s another big smile of a story. Not that he’s just got his life back, but he would have his football career back and have an opportunity to go out there and play,” Beane told reporters at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.

“We’ll continue to support Damar through this whole thing. I would love to give the storybook ending that he’s definitely going to play, but we just don’t know that yet. If he does, we’ll all be very happy for him.”

Video Ad Feedback Damar Hamlin gives first on-camera interview since injury 01:09 - Source: CNN

Speaking on Good Morning America last month, Hamlin said he feels “great” physically but is still “working through things” emotionally.

He said a potential return to the sport is a “tough situation” as it will ultimately be up to him, rather than doctors, to make that call.

“It will be a decision for Damar, but it will also be a decision for us,” Beane continued.

“We want to make sure we’re hearing everything. Assuming he gets full clearance, I know he would want to play. I know that’s his endgame: to continue playing.

“We want to make sure that we’re all in sync, assuming the doctors say at some point, he’s seen them all [and] we’re in agreement that we’re okay putting him out there, too. So far, all is well with his testing and we’ll just let that continue.”

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."," It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.“This is just the beginning.

YouTuber Jake Paul suffered the first defeat of his fledgling boxing career on Sunday night as pro boxer-turned reality TV star Tommy Fury edged him out in a split decision in Saudi Arabia.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh.

“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said after the fight. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show “Love Island.”

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted – Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent’s head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that’s often only allowed for short periods of time.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury’s favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday’s fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

Tick tock, tick tock. The new MLB rules are coming fast at players; just ask Cal Conley.

The Atlanta Braves hitter looked as confused as everyone else on Saturday when the new pitch clock regulation sparked confusion during a spring training game between the Braves and the Boston Red Sox.

With the game tied at 6-6, Conley was sitting on a full count against Robert Kwiatkowski.

However, as the pitch clock hit eight seconds, umpire John Libka jumped in to award strike three with Conley not yet squared up to receive the delivery.

Confused by what had just happened, Conley appeared to jog towards first base thinking that it was Kwiatkowski who had received a time violation for taking too long to pitch his delivery.

“Me?” questioned a baffled Conley, pointing towards himself before it dawned on him that he was being penalized.

The new MLB rules state that hitters must be ready in the batter’s box with eight seconds remaining and Conley was not still going through his preparation at that point.

A league source confirmed to CNN that Libka made the correct call in the game.

With players, fans and coaching staff inside the CoolToday Park all looking confused, the game ended in a 6-6 draw in a chorus of boos.

For Braves manager Brian Snitker, the incident was a reminder that players must instantly adapt to the new rules.

“These are the kind of things that tell you why we’re starting this right now,” he told reporters.

“You never know what might happen. That instance right there shows you what could happen.”

Speeding things up

The new MLB rules are designed to speed up play, with baseball games taking an average of more than three hours to finish.

They dictate that pitchers have 15 seconds to complete a delivery with bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on bases. In addition, batters will be limited to one timeout per plate appearance, and there will also be a 30-second timer between hitters.

New regulations also mean the size of the three bases have grown from 15 inches to 18 inches in the hope of reducing injuries.

If the new rules for the 2023 season are going to usher in a new, faster era for the sport, then it looks likely that players are going to need time to adapt.

However, the changes are being welcomed by some.

“If this is going to be the pace of these games, I’m OK with it,” Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “First look, so far, so good.”

Teams have the remaining of the preseason to make mistakes before more is at stake when the season starts for real on March 30. Tick tock, tick tock."," Tick tock, tick tock.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

Supporters of Turkish soccer team Fenerbahçe, who chanted anti-government slogans during a previous match, have been banned from attending this weekend’s game against Kayserispor, according to a team statement.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber confirmed the decision on Tuesday, saying visiting fans will not be allowed inside the stadium as Fenerbahçe travels to Kayseri, Turkey.

According to TRT Haber, the decision was made due to “security reasons” following a meeting held by the Provincial Security Board.

“We have learned with surprise that our supporters will not be allowed to be in the stadium when we play against Yukatel Kayserispor on Saturday, March 4, 2023, a decision taken by the Kayseri Provincial Security Board,” the statement read.

Fenerbahçe said it is “in no way possible” for the team to accept the decision, calling it a “strange one that has nothing to do with sportive criteria, in a way that will deepen the social polarization.”

“It has no meaning other than hindering our fans’ desire to support our team and punishing our Club,” the Fenerbahçe statement added.

The team demanded to know on what grounds its supporters were banned and called on those involved in the decision to review it.

At a match on Saturday, Fenerbahçe fans chanted anti-government slogans calling for its resignation, amid criticisms of the government’s response to earthquake relief efforts.

In a statement on Sunday, Kayserispor, the host team of the city where this weekend’s upcoming match will be played, released a statement condemning “abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums.”

“We present to the public that the Kayserispor community stands by the state and the nation, shares our national pain from the heart in these disaster days, is against the dirty politics and abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums, and we condemn this,” the team said.

Some Beşiktaş fans also chanted “government resign” in protest against the official response to the disaster during the club’s game against Antalyaspor on Sunday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s partner in government, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) head Devlet Bahçeli, called for soccer games to be played without fans and ended his Beşiktaş membership in light of the anti-government chants.

On Sunday, fans also showered the stadium with teddy bears and other stuffed toys. They will be sent by Beşiktaş to children impacted by the earthquake."," Supporters of Turkish soccer team Fenerbahçe, who chanted anti-government slogans during a previous match, have been banned from attending this weekend’s game against Kayserispor, according to a team statement.Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber confirmed the decision on Tuesday, saying visiting fans will not be allowed inside the stadium as Fenerbahçe travels to Kayseri, Turkey.According to TRT Haber, the decision was made due to “security reasons” following a meeting held by the Provincial Security Board.“We have learned with surprise that our supporters will not be allowed to be in the stadium when we play against Yukatel Kayserispor on Saturday, March 4, 2023, a decision taken by the Kayseri Provincial Security Board,” the statement read.Fenerbahçe said it is “in no way possible” for the team to accept the decision, calling it a “strange one that has nothing to do with sportive criteria, in a way that will deepen the social polarization.”“It has no meaning other than hindering our fans’ desire to support our team and punishing our Club,” the Fenerbahçe statement added.The team demanded to know on what grounds its supporters were banned and called on those involved in the decision to review it.At a match on Saturday, Fenerbahçe fans chanted anti-government slogans calling for its resignation, amid criticisms of the government’s response to earthquake relief efforts.In a statement on Sunday, Kayserispor, the host team of the city where this weekend’s upcoming match will be played, released a statement condemning “abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums.”“We present to the public that the Kayserispor community stands by the state and the nation, shares our national pain from the heart in these disaster days, is against the dirty politics and abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums, and we condemn this,” the team said.Some Beşiktaş fans also chanted “government resign” in protest against the official response to the disaster during the club’s game against Antalyaspor on Sunday.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s partner in government, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) head Devlet Bahçeli, called for soccer games to be played without fans and ended his Beşiktaş membership in light of the anti-government chants.On Sunday, fans also showered the stadium with teddy bears and other stuffed toys.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

Shirtless and mud-spattered – golf fans tuning in to the Honda Classic on Saturday would have been forgiven for thinking they’d switched over to the wrong channel.

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

Almost knee deep in the mud, this time it was shirt and shoes off for Buhai. Unfortunately, he could not repeat his earlier escape effort, as his first attempt barely moved a yard.

Buhai eventually tapped in for another painful double bogey, later carding a four-over par 74 for the round, yet the American was cheered back to the clubhouse by fans.

“A lot of claps. Makes you feel good,” Buhai told reporters. “I feel like my body looks good, and hopefully on TV it makes it look a little bigger.

“It was amazing. This is a pretty new experience for me. Just having a lot of fans. It’s funny, [playing partner] Dylan [Frittelli] was saying, ‘Are you from here? Like how much are you paying these guys to say your name?’ And it’s just really cool because I take a lot of pride.

“It brings warmth to my heart when people are shouting my name, cheering me on. It’s really just a fun experience, and I hope to have more of it.”

A final day 69 saw Bhatia finish tied 49th, 13 shots behind champion Chris Kirk. Having secured victory on his first start as a Korn Ferry Tour member at the Bahamas Great Exuma Classic in January 2022 and making the cut on his major debut at the US Open the previous year, Bhatia already has several career highlights.

Yet his bizarre experience in Florida has him keeping his options open, according to his most recent Instagram post.

“If golf doesn’t work out, might give modeling a try,” the caption read."," Shirtless and mud-spattered – golf fans tuning in to the Honda Classic on Saturday would have been forgiven for thinking they’d switched over to the wrong channel.Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway.

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"," Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.Putellas collects the award for the Best FIFA Women's Player.

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."," Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket.

Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation on Monday, acknowledging “change” is required as its national team programs’ collective bargaining negotiations continue.

Bontis, who was elected to the position in November 2020, left his post in the wake of a letter from the 13 members of the provincial and territorial organizations, a group known as the Presidents Forum, requesting his resignation – citing a loss in faith of his ability to lead the organization – according to Canadian sports television network TSN.

“Canada Soccer and both of our National Team Programs have the real potential to sign a historic collective bargaining agreement. Once signed, it will be a landmark deal that will set our nation apart from virtually every other FIFA Member Association,” Bontis said in a written statement Monday.

“While I have been one of the biggest proponents of equalizing the competitive performance environment for our Women’s National Team, I will unfortunately not be leading this organization when it happens. I acknowledge that this moment requires change.”

The Canadian men’s and women’s national teams have been in negotiations for a new contract, with the women seeking equal pay relative to the men’s team.

The women’s national team has been playing what it has termed as “operating under a protest” while its pay equity dispute with the national federation remains unresolved.

Earlier this month, the Canadian Soccer Players Association, which represents the women’s team, said it would be “taking job action” and said in a statement the players are “demanding immediate change.

In the lead up to the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year, the men’s national team went on strike in June, angered over the lack of a deal for the splitting of World Cup bonuses.

At the time, the men’s players said they were, in part, seeking “an equitable structure with our women’s national team that shares the same player match fees, percentage of prize money earned at our respective FIFA World Cups and the development of a women’s domestic league,” according to a letter TSN had obtained.

At just 16 years old, Mia Brookes became the youngest snowboarding world champion after winning gold in the women’s slopestyle at the Snowboard, Freestyle and Freeski World Championships in Bakuriani, Georgia on Monday.

Brookes claimed her win in style – becoming the first woman to land a CAB 1440 double grab in official competition – as the British teenager also secured her country’s first snowboard slopestyle world title.

“I feel like I could cry, I’ve never been so happy in my life,” Brookes told reporters after her win.

Brookes was too young to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing last year but showed few nerves on the big stage.

The British teenager sat second after her first run in Bakuriani but pulled out all the stops in her second attempt.

The 16-year-old, competing in her first year on the senior circuit, performed the highly complicated CAB 1440 double grab – which involves four full rotations in the air – to earn a winning score of 91.38.

“I actually can’t believe it,” she said about landing the trick, per GB Snowsport. “When I did it, I wasn’t sure I’d managed it, but I thought about it and was like yep, I’ve done a 14!”

New Zealand’s reigning Olympic champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took silver with a score of 88.78, while Japan’s Onitsuka Miyabi won bronze with 83.05.

“What Mia’s done out here today is just next level,” GB Snowsport head coach Pat Sharples said.

“We all know Mia’s got the talent, but this is her first season on the WC circuit and her first World championships so to land a run like that with all the pressure of a World Championships tells you everything you need to know about her.

“We’re all so stoked for Mia, her coaches Mikey and Ben, her parents Vicky and Nige, and the whole team around her.”

Exciting talent

Brookes, who is still at school, has long been considered one of the most talented youngsters in the world of winter sports.

She was just 18-months old when she first tried snowboarding, honing her skills in both the UK and on European ski trips with her parents.

However, it’s not always been plane sailing for the youngster.

In 2021, she suffered a serious concussion while snowboarding, per Team GB, and had to be airlifted off the slopes.

While admitting that she still gets a little scared when competing, the Winter Olympics in 2026 at Milan-Cortina remain a big goal in her life.

“The Olympic rings are at the end of the tunnel,” she told Team GB.

“But I take it day by day and think about what I need to improve on next.

The San Diego Padres have signed third baseman Manny Machado to a new 11-year contract through the 2033 season, the team announced Tuesday.

The contract extension is worth $350 million, according to Spotrac, making it the fourth-highest contract in MLB history.

“This has been a long journey,” Machado said, per MLB. “We’re here. We signed a contract four years ago. We had long conversations, and it was great.

“[The Padres] have gone above and beyond for this organization, for this city, made a lot of promises that have come true.”

“In my mind I was always going to be a Padre.

“It’s awesome to see the faces, the teammates now,” Machado added. “We’ve got a whole city behind us. Just a lot has changed over the years, a lot of promises have been made and they’ve come true.”

Machado is a six-time MLB All-Star and last season finished second in the MVP voting in the National League.

The Padres are yet to win a World Series, losing in their two visits in 1984 and in 1998, but now have genuine title aspirations with Machado committed alongside fellow stars Xander Bogaerts, Juan Soto, Yu Darvish and Josh Hader.

Machado last signed a contract with the Padres in 2019 and was reportedly planning to exercise an option in his deal to opt out after the coming season, before agreeing to an additional $170 million over five years.

“For the fans of San Diego: We’re going to be here for the long haul,” Machado added. “My family and I are going to do a lot of great things for this organization, we’re going to go above and beyond for it, and, hopefully, bring a championship to the city that’s been craving it.

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup. Ulrik Pedersen/CSM/Zuma/AP“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told  Sports.“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison. Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty ImagesPalestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.Identification cardsHamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021. Suhaib Salem/ReutersThe politics of travelNicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told  that the politics of travel can be divisive.“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.In a statement to , a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told  Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.‘Love of football’Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.The president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022.

That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told  Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesThere will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.In a statement sent to , the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.USA Boxing reactsIn a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”",,"Swiss, Russian, Paris, Dutch, Arbitration, New Delhi, Belarusian, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Milan, Canada, Europe, Ukrainian, Ireland, Reuters, Los Angeles, United States","Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields, Katie Taylor, Andy Cruz, Keyshawn Davis, Buda, Serbian IOC, Nenad Lalovic, Mohamed Moustahsane, Thomas Bach, Boris, Vorst, Sport, Umar Kremlev, Sonu, Pat McCormack, Cuba, Roniel Iglesias, Andrei Zamkovoi, Aidan Walsh, Luis, Mike McAtee, Paris, Ukraine, Oleg Ilchenko, Ilchenko","Ancient Greece, International Boxing Association, IBA, International, IOC, Paris, Team Cuba, Team, UK, Umar Kremlev, announcementOn, Tashkent, US, NOCs, National Federations, USA, USA Boxing, FBU, Boxing Federation","Nicola,Adams,USA,Boxing,International,Association,IBA,the,Olympic,Committee,Reuters,Team,IOC,Gazprom,The,Court,of,Arbitration,for,Sport,ruled,a,month,later,Paris,2024.The,Kremlin,“,Movement,Russian,'s,EB,National,Federations,IOC.USA,McAtee,FBU,Federation,Ukraine","US, Paris, Tokyo, UK, New, Delhi, Tashkent, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyiv, Milan, Canada, Cuba, Ireland, the, United, States","Ancient, Greece, Muhammad, Ali, George, Foreman, Joe, Frazier, Claressa, Shields, Katie, Taylor, away?Andy, Cruz, Keyshawn, Davis, Buda, Mendes, Nenad, Lalovic, Mohamed, Moustahsane, Thomas, Bach, Umar, Kremlev, Boris, van, der, Vorst, Sonu, Mehta, Pat, McCormack, Roniel, Iglesias, Andrei, Zamkovoi, Aidan, Walsh, Luis, Robayo, Mike, McAtee, Oleg, Ilchenko","Belarusian, Europe"

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night."," Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight.

Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation on Monday, acknowledging “change” is required as its national team programs’ collective bargaining negotiations continue.

Bontis, who was elected to the position in November 2020, left his post in the wake of a letter from the 13 members of the provincial and territorial organizations, a group known as the Presidents Forum, requesting his resignation – citing a loss in faith of his ability to lead the organization – according to Canadian sports television network TSN.

“Canada Soccer and both of our National Team Programs have the real potential to sign a historic collective bargaining agreement. Once signed, it will be a landmark deal that will set our nation apart from virtually every other FIFA Member Association,” Bontis said in a written statement Monday.

“While I have been one of the biggest proponents of equalizing the competitive performance environment for our Women’s National Team, I will unfortunately not be leading this organization when it happens. I acknowledge that this moment requires change.”

The Canadian men’s and women’s national teams have been in negotiations for a new contract, with the women seeking equal pay relative to the men’s team.

The women’s national team has been playing what it has termed as “operating under a protest” while its pay equity dispute with the national federation remains unresolved.

Earlier this month, the Canadian Soccer Players Association, which represents the women’s team, said it would be “taking job action” and said in a statement the players are “demanding immediate change.

In the lead up to the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year, the men’s national team went on strike in June, angered over the lack of a deal for the splitting of World Cup bonuses.

At the time, the men’s players said they were, in part, seeking “an equitable structure with our women’s national team that shares the same player match fees, percentage of prize money earned at our respective FIFA World Cups and the development of a women’s domestic league,” according to a letter TSN had obtained.

Canada is one of the co-hosts of the next men’s World Cup in 2026. The women, who are preparing for the upcoming World Cup this summer, are the reigning Olympic champions."," Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation on Monday, acknowledging “change” is required as its national team programs’ collective bargaining negotiations continue.Bontis, who was elected to the position in November 2020, left his post in the wake of a letter from the 13 members of the provincial and territorial organizations, a group known as the Presidents Forum, requesting his resignation – citing a loss in faith of his ability to lead the organization – according to Canadian sports television network TSN.“Canada Soccer and both of our National Team Programs have the real potential to sign a historic collective bargaining agreement.

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

The ""Taste of the Masters"" bundle is back for 2023. The Masters

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Sandwiches have headlined The Masters concessions menu for years. Jamie Squire/Getty Images

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."," Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket.

After emerging from his darkness retreat, it’s still not known what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will do in the future, saying in an interview that he will “make a decision soon enough.”

“It’s best for anybody who has an interest in this to make a decision sooner rather than later,” Rodgers said in an interview on the Aubrey Marcus Podcast.

“I remember when (Brett) Favre, before he retired, there were times where it was in April and May, we weren’t sure if he was going to come back because he didn’t come to any of the offseason program.

“Then in 2008, he actually did retire in March and then kind of said, ‘No, no, no,’ in June after OTAs, ‘I actually want to come back and play.’ That’s when he was traded to the Jets. There was obviously a lot of tension that summer.

“For everybody involved, directly and indirectly, it’s best for a decision earlier.”

Darkness retreat

Earlier this month, Rodgers announced he was heading to a “darkness retreat” shortly after the Super Bowl.

He said he would be in total darkness for four days and nights – though he could leave at any point if he wished to do so – and added that the whole experience could produce hallucinations similar to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

Rodgers said his time in isolation would help him find inner peace of mind as he decided on his future in the NFL.

In the interview since leaving the retreat, he went on to say that he’s not looking for someone to tell him what the answer is.

“All the answers are right inside me,” he said. “I touched many of them, and definitely the feelings, on both sides, during the darkness, and I’m thankful for that time.

“There’s a finality to the decision. I don’t make it lightly. I don’t want to drag anybody around. Look, I’m answering questions about it because I get asked about it. I’m talking about it because it’s important to me.

“If you don’t like it and you think it’s drama, you think I’m being a diva or whatever, then just tune it out. That’s fine.

“But this is my life. It’s important to me, and I’ll make a decision soon enough, and then we’ll go down that road and be really excited about it.”"," After emerging from his darkness retreat, it’s still not known what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will do in the future, saying in an interview that he will “make a decision soon enough.”“It’s best for anybody who has an interest in this to make a decision sooner rather than later,” Rodgers said in an interview on the Aubrey Marcus Podcast.“I remember when (Brett) Favre, before he retired, there were times where it was in April and May, we weren’t sure if he was going to come back because he didn’t come to any of the offseason program.“Then in 2008, he actually did retire in March and then kind of said, ‘No, no, no,’ in June after OTAs, ‘I actually want to come back and play.’ That’s when he was traded to the Jets.

Shirtless and mud-spattered – golf fans tuning in to the Honda Classic on Saturday would have been forgiven for thinking they’d switched over to the wrong channel.

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

Almost knee deep in the mud, this time it was shirt and shoes off for Buhai. Unfortunately, he could not repeat his earlier escape effort, as his first attempt barely moved a yard.

Buhai eventually tapped in for another painful double bogey, later carding a four-over par 74 for the round, yet the American was cheered back to the clubhouse by fans.

“A lot of claps. Makes you feel good,” Buhai told reporters. “I feel like my body looks good, and hopefully on TV it makes it look a little bigger.

“It was amazing. This is a pretty new experience for me. Just having a lot of fans. It’s funny, [playing partner] Dylan [Frittelli] was saying, ‘Are you from here? Like how much are you paying these guys to say your name?’ And it’s just really cool because I take a lot of pride.

“It brings warmth to my heart when people are shouting my name, cheering me on. It’s really just a fun experience, and I hope to have more of it.”

Bhatia again found himself shirtless in the mud at the 15th hole. Sam Greenwood/Getty Images

A final day 69 saw Bhatia finish tied 49th, 13 shots behind champion Chris Kirk. Having secured victory on his first start as a Korn Ferry Tour member at the Bahamas Great Exuma Classic in January 2022 and making the cut on his major debut at the US Open the previous year, Bhatia already has several career highlights.

Yet his bizarre experience in Florida has him keeping his options open, according to his most recent Instagram post.

“If golf doesn’t work out, might give modeling a try,” the caption read."," Shirtless and mud-spattered – golf fans tuning in to the Honda Classic on Saturday would have been forgiven for thinking they’d switched over to the wrong channel.Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway.

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

Upset

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."," After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.Krejčíková embraces Świątek after winning the final.

Newcastle United fan Kris Cook was so convinced his club was going to win a first domestic trophy for nearly 70 years that he had a tattoo celebrating the fact on his leg.

The problem was Newcastle ended up losing 2-0 to Manchester United in Sunday’s League Cup final at Wembley.

Cook had the popular club chant “Tell me ma me ma” complete with “NUFC Cup winners 26/02/23” etched on to his skin, but it proved somewhat premature as Newcastle’s wait goes on.

“I asked the lass who does my tattoos: ‘Can you put cup winners on my leg?’” he told the BBC.

“I think she was thinking it was a bad idea at the same time, but I got it done. I think my mam is still a little bit livid, my grandma, she went ballistic – apart from that, all my pals think it’s funny.”

Asked by a BBC Radio Newcastle reporter whether one solution would be to change the N to an M for the sake of accuracy, Cook said he would rather wait for a Newcastle win.

“I wouldn’t have that on my leg – I would rather have one leg to be fair,” he said.

“[It was] dedication or stupidity really, I have always loved [Newcastle], but I didn’t think I’d be walking around with that on my leg for the rest of my life.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

Irv Cross, a former NFL star and broadcasting pioneer who died two years ago at the age of 81, had stage 4 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the Boston University CTE Center said Tuesday.

“Mr. Cross was diagnosed during life with mild cognitive impairment and was found at autopsy to have stage 4 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is the most severe type of the disease,” said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University’s CTE Center, in a statement. “He is one of the 345 former NFL players diagnosed with CTE by the BU CTE Center and UNITE brain bank team out of 376 former NFL players studied.”

Former players studied by the BU CTE Center have chosen to donate their brains to the center or have had their brains donated by their families after their deaths.

CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease, can be found in individuals who have been exposed to repeated head trauma. Studies have found that repetitive hits to the head – even without concussion – can result in CTE.

The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of symptoms including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.

Cross’s widow described the struggle he faced.

“For the last five years of his life Irv stopped being able to do the things he loved and his problems with his balance, memory, and delusions, were very embarrassing and depressing for him,” Liz Cross said in a statement. “His life became a constant struggle, and he suspected it was from CTE. Now that we know for sure, Irv would want others to learn about the disease and the risks of playing tackle football, especially for children.”

Cross, a two-time Pro Bowl cornerback who was drafted in 1961, played nine seasons in the NFL – six for the Philadelphia Eagles and three for the Los Angeles Rams.

He would return to Philadelphia in 1969, becoming a player and coach. After retiring in 1970, he became an Eagles assistant coach.

In his nine seasons, Cross had 22 interceptions, 14 fumble recoveries and two defensive touchdowns.

After his NFL career, Cross became the first African American sports analyst on national television when he worked for CBS Sports as an NFL analyst and commentator from 1971 to 1994.

He anchored the Emmy-winning show “The NFL Today,” from its inception in 1975 through 1989. Cross also covered other sports, including the NBA, track and field, and gymnastics.

In 2009, Cross was the recipient of the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award. The award, which is given annually, recognizes “long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football.”"," Irv Cross, a former NFL star and broadcasting pioneer who died two years ago at the age of 81, had stage 4 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the Boston University CTE Center said Tuesday.“Mr. Cross was diagnosed during life with mild cognitive impairment and was found at autopsy to have stage 4 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is the most severe type of the disease,” said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University’s CTE Center, in a statement. “He is one of the 345 former NFL players diagnosed with CTE by the BU CTE Center and UNITE brain bank team out of 376 former NFL players studied.”Former players studied by the BU CTE Center have chosen to donate their brains to the center or have had their brains donated by their families after their deaths.CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease, can be found in individuals who have been exposed to repeated head trauma.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

A Vermont girls high school basketball team forfeited an out of state tournament after refusing to play against a team that had a transgender player.

Mid Vermont Christian School (MVCS) was set to play Long Trail School on February 21, but MVCS forfeited the game due to a transgender player on Long Trail’s roster, according to the head of school at MVCS, Vicky Fogg.

“We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,” Fogg said in a statement.

“Allowing biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”

The Vermont Principals’ Association (VPA) policy on gender identity, the state’s governing body for school sports, says students are able to participate in athletic activities “in a manner consistent with their gender identity,” which is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices for Schools Regarding Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students.

The VPA shared with CNN on Monday that it “reiterates its support for each student” following the incident.

The Long Trail team advanced to round two of the tournament due to the forfeit and played on Friday, according to the school’s website.

CNN has reached out to Long Trail for comment but has not received a response.

Transgender athlete bans in US sport

While sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity.

The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories.

The debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint in recent years, especially among conservatives.

Earlier this year, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to protest the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s college sports.

A number of GOP-led states – among them Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia – have in recent years been successful in banning trans youth from competing in sport, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue conservatives are creating an issue where there isn’t one.

Advocates of such measures have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages over cisgender women and girls in sports, while critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face, particularly trans youth.

Trans youth are a small and vulnerable group that, LGBTQ advocates say, are largely misunderstood, making their existence ripe for attacks.

A 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth have seriously considered suicide, and a 2021 Williams Institute study reports 30% of transgender youth have attempted suicide in the year prior to the study."," A Vermont girls high school basketball team forfeited an out of state tournament after refusing to play against a team that had a transgender player.Mid Vermont Christian School (MVCS) was set to play Long Trail School on February 21, but MVCS forfeited the game due to a transgender player on Long Trail’s roster, according to the head of school at MVCS, Vicky Fogg.“We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,” Fogg said in a statement.“Allowing biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”The Vermont Principals’ Association (VPA) policy on gender identity, the state’s governing body for school sports, says students are able to participate in athletic activities “in a manner consistent with their gender identity,” which is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices for Schools Regarding Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students.The VPA shared with  on Monday that it “reiterates its support for each student” following the incident.The Long Trail team advanced to round two of the tournament due to the forfeit and played on Friday, according to the school’s website. has reached out to Long Trail for comment but has not received a response.Transgender athlete bans in US sportWhile sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity.The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories.The debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint in recent years, especially among conservatives.Earlier this year, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to protest the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s college sports.A number of GOP-led states – among them Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia – have in recent years been successful in banning trans youth from competing in sport, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue conservatives are creating an issue where there isn’t one.Advocates of such measures have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages over cisgender women and girls in sports, while critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face, particularly trans youth.Trans youth are a small and vulnerable group that, LGBTQ advocates say, are largely misunderstood, making their existence ripe for attacks.A 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth have seriously considered suicide, and a 2021 Williams Institute study reports 30% of transgender youth have attempted suicide in the year prior to the study.",West Virginia,"Long, San, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas","Vermont Christian School, Vicky, Fogg, Schools Regarding Transgender, Long Trail, Alabama, Montana, Williams Institute","MVCS, Vermont Principals, VPA, Vermont Agency, Education Best Practices, Gender, NCAA Convention, LGBTQ, National Survey, LGBTQ Youth Mental Health","Mid,Vermont,Christian,School,MVCS,Principals,’,Association,VPA,the,Agency,of,Education,Best,Practices,NCAA,Convention,GOP,LGBTQ,Youth,Mental,Health,Williams,Institute","Vermont, Trail, US, San, Antonio, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas, West, Virginia","Vicky, Fogg, Gender, Nonconforming, Students",

There have been a lot of dull outfits on the fairways over the years – monochrome colors, polo shirts, and plain caps galore. Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart’s sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA’s 1999 Ryder Cup outfit – so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

Some looks became a signature. Head to toe in fluorescent orange? Had to be Rickie Fowler. Cowboy hat and belt? Shingo Katayama was in town.

At just 16 years old, Mia Brookes became the youngest snowboarding world champion after winning gold in the women’s slopestyle at the Snowboard, Freestyle and Freeski World Championships in Bakuriani, Georgia on Monday.

Brookes claimed her win in style – becoming the first woman to land a CAB 1440 double grab in official competition – as the British teenager also secured her country’s first snowboard slopestyle world title.

“I feel like I could cry, I’ve never been so happy in my life,” Brookes told reporters after her win.

Brookes was too young to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing last year but showed few nerves on the big stage.

The British teenager sat second after her first run in Bakuriani but pulled out all the stops in her second attempt.

The 16-year-old, competing in her first year on the senior circuit, performed the highly complicated CAB 1440 double grab – which involves four full rotations in the air – to earn a winning score of 91.38.

“I actually can’t believe it,” she said about landing the trick, per GB Snowsport. “When I did it, I wasn’t sure I’d managed it, but I thought about it and was like yep, I’ve done a 14!”

New Zealand’s reigning Olympic champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took silver with a score of 88.78, while Japan’s Onitsuka Miyabi won bronze with 83.05.

“What Mia’s done out here today is just next level,” GB Snowsport head coach Pat Sharples said.

“We all know Mia’s got the talent, but this is her first season on the WC circuit and her first World championships so to land a run like that with all the pressure of a World Championships tells you everything you need to know about her.

“We’re all so stoked for Mia, her coaches Mikey and Ben, her parents Vicky and Nige, and the whole team around her.”

Exciting talent

Brookes, who is still at school, has long been considered one of the most talented youngsters in the world of winter sports.

She was just 18-months old when she first tried snowboarding, honing her skills in both the UK and on European ski trips with her parents.

However, it’s not always been plane sailing for the youngster.

In 2021, she suffered a serious concussion while snowboarding, per Team GB, and had to be airlifted off the slopes.

While admitting that she still gets a little scared when competing, the Winter Olympics in 2026 at Milan-Cortina remain a big goal in her life.

“The Olympic rings are at the end of the tunnel,” she told Team GB.

“But I take it day by day and think about what I need to improve on next. The Olympics would be quite cool.”"," At just 16 years old, Mia Brookes became the youngest snowboarding world champion after winning gold in the women’s slopestyle at the Snowboard, Freestyle and Freeski World Championships in Bakuriani, Georgia on Monday.Brookes claimed her win in style – becoming the first woman to land a CAB 1440 double grab in official competition – as the British teenager also secured her country’s first snowboard slopestyle world title.“I feel like I could cry, I’ve never been so happy in my life,” Brookes told reporters after her win.Brookes was too young to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing last year but showed few nerves on the big stage.The British teenager sat second after her first run in Bakuriani but pulled out all the stops in her second attempt.The 16-year-old, competing in her first year on the senior circuit, performed the highly complicated CAB 1440 double grab – which involves four full rotations in the air – to earn a winning score of 91.38.Brookes competing in Bakuriani, Georgia, on February 27.

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

18,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,"CNN —

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart.

19,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/23/sport/campbell-johnstone-all-blacks-rugby-spt-intl,"CNN —

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"," During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.“I loved playing rugby,” he tells  Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France. Phil Rees/ShutterstockOn top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”",,"New Zealand, Wales, France, Australia, Spain, New","Campbell Johnstone, Johnstone, Sport, Ruby Tui, Aaron Smith, Grant Robertson, Phil, Nigel Owens, Gareth Thomas, Owens, Thomas, Dan Palmer","All Blacks, Ospreys, Canterbury, Crusaders, All, Wales, US",Johnstone,"New, Zealand, Wales, France, Canterbury, Australia, Spain, US","Campbell, Johnstone, Ruby, Tui, Aaron, Smith, Grant, Robertson, Ospreys, Phil, Rees, /, ShutterstockOn, Biarritz, Nigel, Owens, Thomas, Dan, Palmer",

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"," Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.Putellas collects the award for the Best FIFA Women's Player.

Umpires for the spring training preseason game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates were not fussed about working any overtime on Tuesday as they left the field before the players.

In fairness to the officials, the game had officially ended when Baltimore’s Josh Lester grounded out to second base at the top of the ninth with the Pirates leading 7-4.

But due to a prior discussion between Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Baltimore boss Brandon Hyde, the decision was made to keep the players out for the bottom of the ninth in order to give right-hander Ofreidy Gómez some practice against live hitters.

The game continued without umpires as many supporters started making their way out of the stadium.

According to MLB, catcher Maverick Handley was given the extra responsibility of calling balls and strikes for the rest of the game.

“A little backfield action,” Hyde told reporters after the game, per MLB.

It’s not unheard of for teams to decide to play a little longer during spring training games, but the umpires have no obligation to stick around.

Clearly not on board with Tuesday’s plan, the officials simply walked off the field after a brief discussion. Perhaps they had dinner reservations?

It’s yet another bizarre moment in this year’s preseason where players have been getting used to the new regulations brought in to speed up games for 2023.

They have until the season starts for real on March 30 to get used to the changes and umpires will soon be obliged to stick around until the final pitch to enforce them."," Umpires for the spring training preseason game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates were not fussed about working any overtime on Tuesday as they left the field before the players.In fairness to the officials, the game had officially ended when Baltimore’s Josh Lester grounded out to second base at the top of the ninth with the Pirates leading 7-4.But due to a prior discussion between Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Baltimore boss Brandon Hyde, the decision was made to keep the players out for the bottom of the ninth in order to give right-hander Ofreidy Gómez some practice against live hitters.The game continued without umpires as many supporters started making their way out of the stadium.According to MLB, catcher Maverick Handley was given the extra responsibility of calling balls and strikes for the rest of the game.“A little backfield action,” Hyde told reporters after the game, per MLB.It’s not unheard of for teams to decide to play a little longer during spring training games, but the umpires have no obligation to stick around.Clearly not on board with Tuesday’s plan, the officials simply walked off the field after a brief discussion.

Embattled French Football Federation (FFF) president Noël Le Graët has resigned, the federation announced in a statement on Tuesday.

“Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.

It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”

FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.

Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.

Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”

According to Reuters, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport.

Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported. CNN has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment.

Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.

In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.

He later apologized to Zidane for the remarks.

Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.

But he also has a record of making controversial comments, saying in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.

“I would not stop the games. I do not want to be held hostage on homophobia. There are security services to ensure that these banners disappear,” Le Graët told radio station France Info at the time."," Embattled French Football Federation (FFF) president Noël Le Graët has resigned, the federation announced in a statement on Tuesday.“Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”According to Reuters, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport.Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported.  has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment.Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.He later apologized to Zidane for the remarks.Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.But he also has a record of making controversial comments, saying in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.“I would not stop the games.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"," Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells  Sports.Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

French judicial authorities have opened an investigation for rape into Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi, a source close to the investigation confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

The Nanterre prosecutor’s office, just outside of Paris, is leading the investigation, the source added.

Spanish-born Moroccan Hakimi is a full-back for Paris Saint-Germain and plays for the Moroccan national side. He scored the penalty kick that took Morocco to the World Cup semifinals during Qatar 2022.

“The Nanterre prosecutor’s office does not wish to comment on this ongoing investigation, as the information already published jeopardizes the inquiries necessary for finding the truth,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN.

CNN has reached out to Hakimi for comment.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, a PSG spokesperson said the club “supports the player who has firmly denied the accusations and trusts the justice system. Paris Saint-Germain is an institution that promotes respect on and off the pitch.”

Hakimi, who is considered one of the best defenders in the world, joined PSG from Inter Milan in 2021. He now plays alongside superstars such as Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé.

Due to his impressive performances at both club and international levels last year, the 24-year-old was named in the men’s best XI at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday."," French judicial authorities have opened an investigation for rape into Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi, a source close to the investigation confirmed to  on Tuesday.The Nanterre prosecutor’s office, just outside of Paris, is leading the investigation, the source added.Spanish-born Moroccan Hakimi is a full-back for Paris Saint-Germain and plays for the Moroccan national side.

Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he “would love to give the storybook ending” to Damar Hamlin’s recovery from a cardiac arrest, but admitted it’s still unclear whether the 24-year-old would play again.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.

The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin’s heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.

On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is “doing great” as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.

“If he’s able to get full clearance and he feels he’s ready to do it, that’s another big smile of a story. Not that he’s just got his life back, but he would have his football career back and have an opportunity to go out there and play,” Beane told reporters at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.

“We’ll continue to support Damar through this whole thing. I would love to give the storybook ending that he’s definitely going to play, but we just don’t know that yet. If he does, we’ll all be very happy for him.”

Video Ad Feedback Damar Hamlin gives first on-camera interview since injury 01:09 - Source: CNN

Speaking on Good Morning America last month, Hamlin said he feels “great” physically but is still “working through things” emotionally.

He said a potential return to the sport is a “tough situation” as it will ultimately be up to him, rather than doctors, to make that call.

“It will be a decision for Damar, but it will also be a decision for us,” Beane continued.

“We want to make sure we’re hearing everything. Assuming he gets full clearance, I know he would want to play. I know that’s his endgame: to continue playing.

“We want to make sure that we’re all in sync, assuming the doctors say at some point, he’s seen them all [and] we’re in agreement that we’re okay putting him out there, too. So far, all is well with his testing and we’ll just let that continue.”

Beane said that Hamlin has seen several specialists since the NFL season concluded and that there are two or three more specialists he has to see."," Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he “would love to give the storybook ending” to Damar Hamlin’s recovery from a cardiac arrest, but admitted it’s still unclear whether the 24-year-old would play again.Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin’s heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is “doing great” as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.“If he’s able to get full clearance and he feels he’s ready to do it, that’s another big smile of a story.

The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.

During the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: “Fkn sucks!!!!”

Just another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s play-in tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday’s win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our a*s.”

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in – James’ injury permitting.

Who knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method."," The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.During the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup.

Paul Pogba made his long-awaited return to football after almost a year on the sidelines in Juventus’ 4-2 win against city rival Torino in Serie A.

The former world champion came off the bench in the 69th minute with the scores level at 2-2 and helped the Bianconeri seal a much-needed win.

Late goals from former Torino defender Gleison Bremer and Adrien Rabiot were enough for La Vecchia Signora to seal victory in the “Derby della Mole” and take it into seventh in Serie A. The Old Lady sits 10 points behind Lazio for the fourth and the final qualification spot for the Champions League.

France star Pogba has not featured in a competitive match for 315 days, last making an appearance in a Manchester United shirt in the Red Devils’ 4-0 loss to Liverpool on April 19, 2022.

After a disappointing final few years in England, Pogba returned to Turin as a free agent in July 2022. But just two weeks after signing a four-year deal, the midfield maestro injured his right meniscus.

He was initially ruled out for two months, but after failing to recover, he underwent surgery that saw him miss the World Cup where France reached the final.

Coach Massimiliano Allegri was pleased with Pogba’s return, who was making his second debut for the club, having played for the club in a trophy-laden spell from 2012 to 2016 before making a then-record transfer to Manchester United.

“It had been a long time since we wanted Pogba back with us and we are happy. With a game every three days, we need everyone available,” Allegri told DAZN and Sky Sport Italia after the game.

The 2018 World Cup winner’s return to competitive football hopefully signals the end of what has been a tumultuous year for the 29-year-old.

On his birthday in March last year, while he was playing in Manchester United’s Champions League match against Atlético Madrid, his home was burgled while his two children were sleeping. He later revealed that his World Cup winner’s medal was among the items stolen.

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, the France star disclosed more details about his time in Manchester saying, “Sometimes, you don’t know you’re depressed. You only want to isolate yourself, be alone, and these are signs that don’t deceive.”

In August, French police opened an investigation and detained Pogba’s brother, Mathias, for allegations of extortion made by Paul’s legal team.

The allegations came after his brother released a series of videos on Instagram in English, French, Spanish and Italian in which he claimed that he would make “great revelations” about the conduct of his brother and Rafaela Pimenta, his agent.

Pogba’s forgettable 2022 was capped off by his absence from the Qatar World Cup where France agonizingly lost the final in a penalty shootout against Lionel Messi’s Argentina.

Pogba’s return to the Juve squad comes at a pivotal time as the Italian giant tries to close the gap with the top four of Serie A after the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) handed the club a 15-point penalty in January for false accounting.

The punishment is part of the ‘plusvalenze’ saga in Italy – translating to capital gains – in which Juventus and 10 other clubs were investigated for “having accounted for capital gains and players’ rights to services in their financial reports for values exceeding those permitted by accounting standards,” according to the FIGC.

Juve is also seeking European silverware; it is in the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League where it faces German club Freiburg.

The club was knocked out of the Champions League group stage by Paris Saint-Germain and Portuguese giant Benfica. After dropping into the Europa League playoff, Juventus beat French club Nantes 4-1 on aggregate to set up a tie with Freiburg."," Paul Pogba made his long-awaited return to football after almost a year on the sidelines in Juventus’ 4-2 win against city rival Torino in Serie A.The former world champion came off the bench in the 69th minute with the scores level at 2-2 and helped the Bianconeri seal a much-needed win.Late goals from former Torino defender Gleison Bremer and Adrien Rabiot were enough for La Vecchia Signora to seal victory in the “Derby della Mole” and take it into seventh in Serie A.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

A court in San Marino has fined Italian professional cyclist Antonio Tiberi 4,000 euros (around $4,250) after he pleaded guilty to shooting a cat belonging to the tiny republic’s minister of tourism, Federico Pedini Amati, a court spokesperson confirmed to CNN.

Tiberi, an Italian who lives in San Marino, also risks losing his residency status after the conviction.

He admitted to testing out an air rifle he purchased last June by aiming at the head of the cat belonging to his neighbor, Amati, according to the court. The cat immediately died in the incident.

The 21-year-old Tiberi, who won a time trial bronze at the Junior European Road Championships in 2018 and a time trial gold at the Junior Road World Championships in 2019, apologized for the incident on Twitter.

“I deeply regret my shameful actions,” he wrote in a statement.

“I did something tremendously stupid and irresponsible, the seriousness and danger of which I realized only after the act. I don’t want to make excuses.”

Tiberi added that he would donate his prize money from this season’s winnings to animal welfare organizations in San Marino, as well as volunteering with those organizations in person.

His Trek-Segafredo team also tweeted a response, condemning Tiberi for his actions and announcing that it would suspend him for a minimum of 20 days without pay, which will include three races in Italy.

The team said it would donate Tiberi’s suspended pay to an appropriate animal care, protection and rescue organization.

“Trek-Segafredo would like to reiterate its great disappointment in Antonio’s conduct,” the statement said. “The team strives to help riders improve not just as athletes, but as men and women.

“The team will work closely with Antonio to ensure he educates himself and expects him to take necessary steps to express his remorse and become a better person.”

Pedini Amati told Italy’s Corriere Della Sera newspaper that the cat was a beloved pet of his three-year-old daughter, Lucia, who “loved it.”

He condemned the light sentence and fine and called for Tiberi’s residency to be stripped.

“You cannot kill a pet and get away with a €4,000 euro fine,” Pedini Amati said. “I appreciated that the young man admitted the fact, having said that, we do not need to give residence to these people.”

Pedini Amati did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN."," A court in San Marino has fined Italian professional cyclist Antonio Tiberi 4,000 euros (around $4,250) after he pleaded guilty to shooting a cat belonging to the tiny republic’s minister of tourism, Federico Pedini Amati, a court spokesperson confirmed to .Tiberi, an Italian who lives in San Marino, also risks losing his residency status after the conviction.He admitted to testing out an air rifle he purchased last June by aiming at the head of the cat belonging to his neighbor, Amati, according to the court.

French soccer legend Just Fontaine, who still holds the record for most goals scored by a player at a single World Cup, has died aged 89, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced.

The former striker scored 13 goals in six matches at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, putting him joint-fourth alongside Lionel Messi on the all-time top scorers list, as France finished the tournament in third place.

It is considered one of the greatest records in international soccer, with no player coming close to matching it in the 65 years since it was set.

“The death of Just Fontaine plunges French football into deep emotion and immense sadness,” FFF interim president Philippe Diallo said in a statement. “Just Fontaine left his mark on football in France and abroad.

“He was an emblematic figure, with an incredible record of 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup. He wrote one of the most beautiful pages of the history of the French national team.”

Fontaine won the French league with Reims three times and once with Nice, while also picking up two French Cup titles during an illustrious career.

His exploits at the 1958 World Cup earned him third place on in the Ballon d’Or that year.

Fontaine was also part of the Reims side that reached the European Cup final in 1959, where it eventually lost out to the great Real Madrid team of that time.

“A star of French football, an unmatched goalscorer, a Reims legend,” former club Stade de Reims said. “The SDR sends its sincere condolences to his family and friends.”

Current French national team head coach Didier Deschamps said: “The death of Just Fontaine makes me sad, as it will make all of those who love football and our national team sad. ‘Justo’ is and will remain a legend of the French national team.”

Fontaine was born in Morocco and played for Moroccan club Casablanca before moving to France, where he would spend three seasons with Nice and then six with Reims.

He was eventually forced to retire early at the age of just 28 due to injury and went on to coach the French and Moroccan national team and Paris Saint-Germain, earning promotion to the French first division in 1974.

He finished his international career with 30 goals in just 21 games and in 2004, Pele named Fontaine on his list of the 125 greatest living footballers."," French soccer legend Just Fontaine, who still holds the record for most goals scored by a player at a single World Cup, has died aged 89, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced.The former striker scored 13 goals in six matches at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, putting him joint-fourth alongside Lionel Messi on the all-time top scorers list, as France finished the tournament in third place.It is considered one of the greatest records in international soccer, with no player coming close to matching it in the 65 years since it was set.“The death of Just Fontaine plunges French football into deep emotion and immense sadness,” FFF interim president Philippe Diallo said in a statement. “Just Fontaine left his mark on football in France and abroad.Just Fontaine poses with a trophy for the 1958 football World Cup top-scorer award.

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."," It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.“This is just the beginning.

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

Upset

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."," After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.Krejčíková embraces Świątek after winning the final.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

Comas joins pitcher Solomon Bates, who came out as gay after being released in 2022 when he was a minor leaguer in the Giants organization, and former Brewers farmhand David Denson, who became the first openly gay active player in affiliated baseball in 2015."," Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over.

It’s that time of year when hope is plentiful and everything looks a bit brighter.

Yes, it is the beginning of spring, but it is also the start of the NFL offseason whose first major event is the scouting combine.

The showpiece stage for draft hopefuls welcomes the beginning of prediction season and marks when last year’s disappointments change into this year’s reasons for optimism.

Stars can solidify their status at the top while unheralded prospects can surprise everyone with their athletic displays; it is impossible to predict what will happen when this year’s standout college players are put through their paces at the invitation-only affair.

So before the biggest event for teams to evaluate players ahead of next month’s draft in Kansas City, here’s all you need to know about this year’s combine:

How to watch

The NFL scouting combine is the pinnacle for many prospects hoping to be drafted into the professional league so they will be aiming to impress on the biggest stage.

Coverage of the scouting combine is exclusively shown on the NFL Network, which will broadcast all four days.

‘The ultimate four-day job interview’

As is tradition, this year’s combine is held in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis – the home of the Indianapolis Colts.

Having begun in 1982 when Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc. (NFS) conducted the first National Invitational Camp in Florida, it has blossomed from hosting 163 players in its inaugural edition to over 300 expected this year – the NFL said that 319 prospects were invited.

Representatives from all 32 NFL teams will be in attendance – from front office staff and coaches to scouts.

It is held over four days from Thursday, March 2, to Sunday, March 5, with each position group getting their own dedicated portion to showcase their skill sets in front of the watching media and NFL teams.

Defensive linemen and linebackers begin proceedings on Thursday before defensive backs try their hand on Friday.

The weekend begins with arguably the most important day, with quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends displaying their talent Saturday before running backs and offensive lineman close out the combine on Sunday.

Not only will teams be able to watch players be put through their paces, but they will also have the opportunity to interview them in an effort to build out a more complete draft profile, including personality and psychological notes, before making a decision on whether they want to draft them.

Players will also be subjected to medical examinations to allow teams to avoid injury complications down the line.

A full test

The tests the prospects will be put through are aimed at challenging their repertoire of physical capabilities to help teams evaluate the whole package.

The most notable event is the 40-yard dash which sees prospects sprint the distance to display their top speed.

John Ross set the record with the fastest 40-yard time in 2017, running 4.22 seconds. Last year, it looked like Ross’ record might have been broken when Baylor’s Tyquan Thornton ran an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds – it was later made official with a time of 4.28 seconds.

Thornton’s Baylor teammate, Kalon Barnes, was just slower with a time of 4.23 seconds. UTSA’s Tariq Woolen, who would go on to be voted to the Pro Bowl after his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, ran 4.26 seconds.

It’s unlikely Ross’ record will be broken, but there are some serious speedsters taking to the running track in Indianapolis who could threaten him.

Other physical drills include a bench press – where players bench press 225 pounds as many times as possible – a vertical jump and a broad jump.

The final drills – the three-cone drill, 20-yard shuttle and the 60-yard shuttle – are all designed to test an athlete’s quickness and agility, as they must rush between various points before making short and sharp turns of direction before sprinting in opposite directions.

All in all, it is described on the official NFL website as the “ultimate four-day job interview” with it holding the possibility of catapulting up the draft list or severely hampering one’s stock.

The Chicago Bears currently hold the No. 1 overall pick in April’s draft, with the Houston Texans second and the Arizona Cardinals in third.

Balling out

The biggest names in college football have been invited to the combine this year, with teams and fans alike thrilled at the opportunity to watch them strut their stuff.

The quarterbacks which are expected to be selected near the top of the draft – Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, Will Levis and Anthony Richardson – will be in attendance, although Alabama star Young has reportedly chosen not to thrown, instead choosing to wait for his school’s specific pro-day later in the month.

Many of the other prospects predicted to go near the top of the draft will be in attendance too.

Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr., Texas running back Bijan Robinson, Illinois corner back Devon Witherspoon, Northwestern offensive tackle Peter Skoronski, Texas Tech edge rusher Tyree Wilson, Georgia Tech edge rusher Keion White, Utah tight end Dalton Kincaid and USC wide receiver Jordan Addison are just some of the names on the list.

One of the players who was scheduled to work out and is now unlikely to feature is University of Georgia standout Jalen Carter after he surrendered to police in Athens, Georgia, on Wednesday night on charges related to a crash that killed his teammate and a team staffer hours after they celebrated the Bulldogs’ national championship victory.

Carter – who has been projected as a top pick in the NFL draft next month – turned himself in at the Athens-Clarke County Jail on charges of reckless driving and racing, jail records show. He was booked at 11:33 p.m. and released a short time later at 11:49 p.m.

Carter’s teammate Devin Willock and football team staff member Chandler LeCroy were killed in the January 15 crash, which happened hours after the team participated in a parade through the UGA campus to celebrate its second consecutive national title.

LeCroy was driving a Ford SUV near the campus with Willock and two other members of the football program also in the vehicle, police have said. The SUV was traveling “about 104 miles per hour” before it veered off the road and slammed into two power poles and several trees, Athens-Clarke County police said.

Authorities said Carter was driving a separate vehicle and he and LeCroy appeared to be racing."," It’s that time of year when hope is plentiful and everything looks a bit brighter.Yes, it is the beginning of spring, but it is also the start of the NFL offseason whose first major event is the scouting combine.The showpiece stage for draft hopefuls welcomes the beginning of prediction season and marks when last year’s disappointments change into this year’s reasons for optimism.Stars can solidify their status at the top while unheralded prospects can surprise everyone with their athletic displays; it is impossible to predict what will happen when this year’s standout college players are put through their paces at the invitation-only affair.So before the biggest event for teams to evaluate players ahead of next month’s draft in Kansas City, here’s all you need to know about this year’s combine:How to watchThe NFL scouting combine is the pinnacle for many prospects hoping to be drafted into the professional league so they will be aiming to impress on the biggest stage.Coverage of the scouting combine is exclusively shown on the NFL Network, which will broadcast all four days.‘The ultimate four-day job interview’As is tradition, this year’s combine is held in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis – the home of the Indianapolis Colts.Having begun in 1982 when Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc.

Former Miami Dolphins head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ lawsuit against the NFL and three teams – the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants and the Houston Texans – can proceed instead of going to arbitration, a federal judge said on Wednesday.

Judge Valerie Caproni issued the decision, allowing Flores to pursue his case against the three teams and the NFL through a court, though his suit against the Miami Dolphins and both Steve Wilks’ and Ray Horton’s cases will go through arbitration.

“This case shines an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League (“NFL”) teams. Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,” Caproni wrote in her decision.

Flores’ attorney Doug Wigdor said in a statement: “We are pleased that Coach Flores’ class claims of systematic discrimination against the NFL and several teams will proceed in court and ultimately before a jury of his peers.”

Last year, Flores, who had recently been fired by the Miami Dolphins after three seasons as head coach, filed a federal civil lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring practices for head coaching jobs.

Flores alleged in the suit that Dolphins’ owner Stephen Ross offered to pay him to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged him to purposely violate league tampering rules.

When he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with “disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with,” the lawsuit states.

The Dolphins didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, though when Flores initiated his lawsuit just over a year ago the NFL team said: “We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization.”

“The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.”

Flores also accused the Giants and Broncos of carrying out sham interviews in order to comply with the “Rooney Rule,” which requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for open head coaching jobs.

Last month he was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as a defensive coordinator after spending last season as senior defensive assistant/linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was noted by the Judge Caproni.

In her ruling, she also noted the league’s “long history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers – are incredibly troubling.”

“Given the number of Black men who play and coach football, it is difficult to understand how it could be that, at the time Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit, ‘the NFL had only one Black Head Coach.’”

The Giants declined to comment, while CNN Sport has reached out to the Broncos and Texans for comment.

NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement to CNN: “Diversity and inclusion throughout the NFL make us a better organization. We recognize there is more work to be done and we are deeply committed to doing it.

“That said, we are pleased with the court’s decision, which correctly holds that the vast majority of claims in this case are properly arbitrable by the Commissioner under binding agreements signed by each plaintiff.

“We intend to move forward promptly with arbitrations as directed by the court and will seek to dismiss the remaining claims.”

FIFA’s decision to appoint Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima as its global fan ambassador ahead of the Women’s World Cup has been derided as “tone deaf” and “truly baffling” by former Australian international Moya Dodd.

Soccer’s world governing body announced Monday that Lima, a former Victoria’s Secret model, would “develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives involving fans from all over the world,” while FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the 41-year-old Brazilian “lives and breathes ‘futebol.’”

Dodd, the former vice-captain of Australia’s women’s football team, said on Wednesday that Lima’s public image “looked an odd fit for an organisation that says it wants to empower girls and women, and whose President is required to be “a vanguard” for promoting gender equality (yes, that’s in the FIFA Governance Regulations).”

Dodd, who previously led Fifa’s taskforce on women’s football, wrote on Linkedin: “[W]hen a girl plays football, the world sees her differently. Instead of being complimented on her nice looks or her pretty dress, she is valued for her game-saving tackles and brilliant goal-scoring.

“She’s admired for what she can DO, rather than how she looks, putting her on a more equal footing with her brothers in a way that can alter the whole trajectory of her life’s ambitions.

Dodd said that when a girl plays football, ""she's admired for what she can DO, rather than how she looks"". Stuart Franklin/FIFA/Getty Images

A member of the FIFA’s executive committee from 2013 to 2016, Dodd expanded on her comments, adding that her own research on Lima “showed that this model specifically was known for crash-diet eating & drinking,” and referenced a 2006 GQ article, where the Brazilian is quoted as saying abortion is a crime.

“What will this ambassador represent to the large and growing population of aspirational #womensfootball players and fans who love the game because it shows us what empowerment and equality can look like?” asked Dodd.

Lima’s publicist, Laurent Boye, said the model’s stance had changed since she made those comments 17 years ago.

“We can proudly say that Ms Lima has been promoting a healthy lifestyle for several years and like many people, her position on many LGBTQIA+ and women issues has evolved and she is considered an ally,” Boye said in a statement, Reuters news agency reported.

In a follow-up post, Dodd said that Lima’s view’s on abortion still hadn’t been addressed.

“To be clear, there is no criticism of Lima’s personal choice - everyone should have that right. But denouncing abortion as a crime means that you think others who make a different choice should be treated as criminals and punished accordingly.

“That is a terrifying prospect, and not consistent with women’s empowerment or right to control their own bodies and futures, imho,” Dodd wrote.

CNN has reached out to FIFA for further comment.

In a statement Monday, Lima said she was ” very thankful and honoured to have been chosen by FIFA to be the first Global Fan Ambassador and to be given such a platform to help fans get even closer to the game.”

Ouarda Coussay, a representative for model management agency Elite World Group, which represents Lima, declined further comment when contacted by CNN.

Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he “would love to give the storybook ending” to Damar Hamlin’s recovery from a cardiac arrest, but admitted it’s still unclear whether the 24-year-old would play again.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.

The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin’s heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.

On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is “doing great” as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.

“If he’s able to get full clearance and he feels he’s ready to do it, that’s another big smile of a story. Not that he’s just got his life back, but he would have his football career back and have an opportunity to go out there and play,” Beane told reporters at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.

“We’ll continue to support Damar through this whole thing. I would love to give the storybook ending that he’s definitely going to play, but we just don’t know that yet. If he does, we’ll all be very happy for him.”

Speaking on Good Morning America last month, Hamlin said he feels “great” physically but is still “working through things” emotionally.

He said a potential return to the sport is a “tough situation” as it will ultimately be up to him, rather than doctors, to make that call.

“It will be a decision for Damar, but it will also be a decision for us,” Beane continued.

“We want to make sure we’re hearing everything. Assuming he gets full clearance, I know he would want to play. I know that’s his endgame: to continue playing.

“We want to make sure that we’re all in sync, assuming the doctors say at some point, he’s seen them all [and] we’re in agreement that we’re okay putting him out there, too. So far, all is well with his testing and we’ll just let that continue.”

Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.

If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.

“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we’re going to have more of that.”

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.

“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.

“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.

Ahead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.

“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.

“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.

“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.

“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”

Homa’s ‘rant’

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.

“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.

“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.”"," Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we’re going to have more of that.”World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.However, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.The inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022. Chris Trotman/LIV Golf/Getty ImagesAhead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.Asked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”McIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday. Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesScheffler: Money not a factorDiscussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”Homa’s ‘rant’Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.While he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Michael Reaves/Getty Images“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys.

10,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/golf/cameron-smith-open-celebrations-australian-pga-spt-spc-intl,"CNN —

In July last year, Cameron Smith achieved golfing immortality.

Completing a dramatic late charge to clinch the 150th Open Championship at the legendary St. Andrews Old Course, the Australian could not have wished for a more magical way to secure his first major title.

And yet, celebrations in Scotland were nothing compared to those in Brisbane four months later. A home city victory at the Australian PGA Championship in November put the cherry on top of the delicious cake that was 2022 for Smith.

“That left a really good taste in the mouth for the end of the year,” the 29-year-old told CNN. “There was a few more people there and I think it was kind of a celebration of the year as well.

“I think it was kind of always the plan to go out on that Sunday night and have a drink anyway. So for us to have the Kirkwood Cup there as well, something to drink out of, was awesome.”

‘I play my best golf when I have to be creative’

Viral footage of a pint-wielding Smith being lifted aloft in a nearby pub, gleefully rewatching his winning putt from hours earlier on a TV screen, painted a vivid picture of the extent of the celebrations.

And to be fair, by November, he had enjoyed plenty of practice celebrating. Victory in Brisbane marked Smith’s fifth across all competitions in 2022, a year that had begun with a record-breaking lowest-ever score at the Tournament of Champions in January and was swiftly followed by a lucrative win at the Players Championship in March.

However, on the eve of the Open Championship, Smith was enduring, by his own assessment, “a bit of a crappy run.” Having missed the cut at the US Open in June, a dismal second round at the subsequent Scottish Open had seen him barely make the cut.

That marked the peak of his “mid-season blues,” as Smith rebounded to finish tied 10th and tee up at St. Andrews a week later revitalized and in his element.

“The town there is just so unique, everything’s about golf,” he said. “You don’t really get that anywhere else in the world.

“It’s just such a cool place, and the course is so cool. Playing in those conditions, those windy, firm, fast conditions is something that I really enjoy … I play my best golf when I have to be creative.”

An electric start had seen Smith carry a two-stroke lead into the weekend, only for a disastrous Saturday to leave him four shots adrift of Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland heading into the deciding round.

As Smith made the turn, all eyes remained on the battle between the leading duo behind him. A run of five straight birdies later, he was the talk of a St. Andrews crowd – peppered with a contingent of rapturous Aussies – that sensed a spectacular story brewing.

A final birdie at the 18th to pip playing partner Cameron Young by a stroke sealed a fitting end to a historic comeback win, the largest at St. Andrews since John Daly in 1995.

“It was very surreal,” Smith recalled. “I think it’s something that you dream of and probably you don’t [even] get that far in your dreams.

“There were Aussies screaming out, ‘Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!,’ all that stuff. It was just such an unreal moment.”

Wardrobe change

True to form, Smith promised to celebrate by working out how many beers he could fit in the fabled trophy – two, by his initial estimate. The fact that he vowed to do the same with the Kirkwood Cup, is further evidence that success has not changed the World No. 5.

“I feel as though I’m still the same person. Probably get recognized a little bit more in restaurants and stuff like that,” he said.

“But I think if I change too much, my old man is still giving me a clip around the ear.”

Though Smith will be targeting a wardrobe change for 2023. Specifically, a nice new green jacket.

The 87th edition of The Masters in April represents Smith’s first chance of the season to add another major title, at a fabled Augusta course where he maintains an excellent track record.

Smith has four top-10 finishes in six starts at the major, peaking with a joint runner-up finish in 2020. At last year’s event, he finished tied for third, five shots behind first-time champion Scottie Scheffler.

“I have a really good past there, a really good history,” Smith said.

“I feel like those tournaments you win, you get a good kick here and there and it just hasn’t quite happened for whatever reason around there.

“I feel like I’ve played my best golf by far at Augusta, I just haven’t won around there.”

Shaped like the clubhouse, the Masters trophy looks ill-suited for beer pouring. But rest assured, should Smith succeed this time around, the celebrations could well rival Brisbane regardless."," In July last year, Cameron Smith achieved golfing immortality.Completing a dramatic late charge to clinch the 150th Open Championship at the legendary St. Andrews Old Course, the Australian could not have wished for a more magical way to secure his first major title.And yet, celebrations in Scotland were nothing compared to those in Brisbane four months later.

11,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,"CNN —

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night."," Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight.

A Vermont girls high school basketball team forfeited an out of state tournament after refusing to play against a team that had a transgender player.

Mid Vermont Christian School (MVCS) was set to play Long Trail School on February 21, but MVCS forfeited the game due to a transgender player on Long Trail’s roster, according to the head of school at MVCS, Vicky Fogg.

“We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,” Fogg said in a statement.

“Allowing biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”

The Vermont Principals’ Association (VPA) policy on gender identity, the state’s governing body for school sports, says students are able to participate in athletic activities “in a manner consistent with their gender identity,” which is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices for Schools Regarding Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students.

The VPA shared with CNN on Monday that it “reiterates its support for each student” following the incident.

The Long Trail team advanced to round two of the tournament due to the forfeit and played on Friday, according to the school’s website.

CNN has reached out to Long Trail for comment but has not received a response.

Transgender athlete bans in US sport

While sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity.

The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories.

The debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint in recent years, especially among conservatives.

Earlier this year, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to protest the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s college sports.

A number of GOP-led states – among them Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia – have in recent years been successful in banning trans youth from competing in sport, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue conservatives are creating an issue where there isn’t one.

Advocates of such measures have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages over cisgender women and girls in sports, while critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face, particularly trans youth.

Trans youth are a small and vulnerable group that, LGBTQ advocates say, are largely misunderstood, making their existence ripe for attacks.

A 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth have seriously considered suicide, and a 2021 Williams Institute study reports 30% of transgender youth have attempted suicide in the year prior to the study."," A Vermont girls high school basketball team forfeited an out of state tournament after refusing to play against a team that had a transgender player.Mid Vermont Christian School (MVCS) was set to play Long Trail School on February 21, but MVCS forfeited the game due to a transgender player on Long Trail’s roster, according to the head of school at MVCS, Vicky Fogg.“We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,” Fogg said in a statement.“Allowing biological males to participate in women’s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women’s sports in general.”The Vermont Principals’ Association (VPA) policy on gender identity, the state’s governing body for school sports, says students are able to participate in athletic activities “in a manner consistent with their gender identity,” which is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices for Schools Regarding Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students.The VPA shared with  on Monday that it “reiterates its support for each student” following the incident.The Long Trail team advanced to round two of the tournament due to the forfeit and played on Friday, according to the school’s website. has reached out to Long Trail for comment but has not received a response.Transgender athlete bans in US sportWhile sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity.The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories.The debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint in recent years, especially among conservatives.Earlier this year, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to protest the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s college sports.A number of GOP-led states – among them Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia – have in recent years been successful in banning trans youth from competing in sport, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue conservatives are creating an issue where there isn’t one.Advocates of such measures have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages over cisgender women and girls in sports, while critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face, particularly trans youth.Trans youth are a small and vulnerable group that, LGBTQ advocates say, are largely misunderstood, making their existence ripe for attacks.A 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth have seriously considered suicide, and a 2021 Williams Institute study reports 30% of transgender youth have attempted suicide in the year prior to the study.",West Virginia,"Long, San, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas","Vermont Christian School, Vicky, Fogg, Schools Regarding Transgender, Long Trail, Alabama, Montana, Williams Institute","MVCS, Vermont Principals, VPA, Vermont Agency, Education Best Practices, Gender, NCAA Convention, LGBTQ, National Survey, LGBTQ Youth Mental Health","Mid,Vermont,Christian,School,MVCS,Principals,’,Association,VPA,the,Agency,of,Education,Best,Practices,NCAA,Convention,GOP,LGBTQ,Youth,Mental,Health,Williams,Institute","Vermont, Trail, US, San, Antonio, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas, West, Virginia","Vicky, Fogg, Gender, Nonconforming, Students",

Rival managers and leading figures from the world of soccer have helped raise 845.7 million Turkish liras ($44.8 million) in a single day for the victims of last month’s devastating earthquake that hit 12 provinces and killed more than 44,000 people in Turkey, according to Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency.

The fundraising telethon was aired live on Turkish television by the national broadcasters TRT Sport, A Sports, SportsTV, D Smart Sports, S Sport, Tivibu Sports, TV8 and Club televisions, TRT Radio, Radio Gol, Radyospor, League Radyo, as well as many digital media channels.

Famous soccer players and managers – such as Kylian Mbappé, Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Ruud Gullit, Mikel Arteta, and Arsène Wenger – joined the televised fundraiser called the “shoulder-to-shoulder” fundraising campaign, which is set to run until June 15.

European Club Association (ECA) and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi also donated $2.6 million (50 million Turkish liras) to the campaign, Anadolu and Turkey’s state broadcaster TRT Haber reported.

Turkey’s Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), the Super Lig Clubs Association Foundation and beIN Media Group organized the campaign to meet the needs of citizens affected by earthquakes, Anadolu reported.

More than 48,000 people have died across Turkey and Syria since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on February 6. Meanwhile, almost 900,000 people are living in tents and containers in Turkey following the disaster and subsequent tremors, according to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

The event was not the only fundraising project involving soccer players. Last week, Turkish soccer player Merih Demiral auctioned off jerseys and kits of superstar players like Cristiano Ronaldo as well as World Cup winners Lionel Messi and Gigi Buffon to support survivors of the deadly quake.

The 24-year-old Demiral told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell that he “should do something more” than just donate money himself.

“I called my friend Cristiano, I spoke with him and he said he was really sad also,” he said, adding that the Portuguese star is a “really special guy.”

“I was writing to him, I was explaining to him what happened in Turkey, and he said he was also sad.”

With Ronaldo’s permission, Demiral decided to sell a signed shirt that the soccer star had given him as a gift two years before, while Ronaldo arranged for an additional shirt from his latest club, Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr, to be sent and sold.

Efforts to retrieve survivors have been hampered by a cold winter spell across quake-stricken regions, while authorities grapple with the logistical challenges of transporting aid into northwestern Syria amid an acute humanitarian crisis compounded by years of war.

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

15,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/01/sport/baltimore-orioles-pittsburgh-pirates-umpires-spt-intl,"CNN —

Umpires for the spring training preseason game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates were not fussed about working any overtime on Tuesday as they left the field before the players.

In fairness to the officials, the game had officially ended when Baltimore’s Josh Lester grounded out to second base at the top of the ninth with the Pirates leading 7-4.

But due to a prior discussion between Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Baltimore boss Brandon Hyde, the decision was made to keep the players out for the bottom of the ninth in order to give right-hander Ofreidy Gómez some practice against live hitters.

The game continued without umpires as many supporters started making their way out of the stadium.

According to MLB, catcher Maverick Handley was given the extra responsibility of calling balls and strikes for the rest of the game.

“A little backfield action,” Hyde told reporters after the game, per MLB.

It’s not unheard of for teams to decide to play a little longer during spring training games, but the umpires have no obligation to stick around.

Clearly not on board with Tuesday’s plan, the officials simply walked off the field after a brief discussion. Perhaps they had dinner reservations?

It’s yet another bizarre moment in this year’s preseason where players have been getting used to the new regulations brought in to speed up games for 2023.

They have until the season starts for real on March 30 to get used to the changes and umpires will soon be obliged to stick around until the final pitch to enforce them."," Umpires for the spring training preseason game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates were not fussed about working any overtime on Tuesday as they left the field before the players.In fairness to the officials, the game had officially ended when Baltimore’s Josh Lester grounded out to second base at the top of the ninth with the Pirates leading 7-4.But due to a prior discussion between Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Baltimore boss Brandon Hyde, the decision was made to keep the players out for the bottom of the ninth in order to give right-hander Ofreidy Gómez some practice against live hitters.The game continued without umpires as many supporters started making their way out of the stadium.According to MLB, catcher Maverick Handley was given the extra responsibility of calling balls and strikes for the rest of the game.“A little backfield action,” Hyde told reporters after the game, per MLB.It’s not unheard of for teams to decide to play a little longer during spring training games, but the umpires have no obligation to stick around.Clearly not on board with Tuesday’s plan, the officials simply walked off the field after a brief discussion.

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"," During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.“I loved playing rugby,” he tells  Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan.

An official with a leading human rights group says the Premier League will need to “re-examine the assurances made” about Saudi Arabian state involvement in Newcastle United after a court filing in the US named the club’s chairman as “a sitting minister of the Saudi government.”

The Premier League previously said it received “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United” during the club’s controversial takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2021.

The PIF is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s murder.

In a document filed Tuesday in a California court, lawyers representing the PIF and Newcastle chairman and PIF governor Yasir al-Rumayyan describe the fund as a “sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” and al-Rumayyan as “a sitting minister of the Saudi government.”

The statements were made by lawyers representing LIV Golf, owned by the PIF, in a lawsuit brought against the PGA tour.

Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s Economic Affairs Director, said in a statement sent to CNN that “the Premier League will surely need to re-examine the assurances made about the non-involvement of the Saudi authorities in the Newcastle deal, not least as there’s still a Qatari bid for Manchester United currently on the table.”

Last month, Qatari Shiekh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani officially made a bid for English Premier League club Manchester United.

“It was always stretching credulity to breaking point to imagine that the Saudi state wasn’t directing the buyout of Newcastle United with the ultimate aim of using the club as a component in its wider sportswashing efforts,” added Frankental.

“Sportswashing” is the phenomenon of improving tarnished reputations through sport.

“In the 18 months since the Newcastle purchase, the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia has deteriorated markedly, with scores of executions after unfair trials, courts jailing peaceful critics, and the authorities continuing to block accountability for Jamal Khashoggi’s murder,” said Frankental.

“There’s an unmistakable irony in the sovereign wealth fund declaration emerging in a dispute about another arm of Saudi Arabia’s growing sports empire, but the simple fact is that Saudi sportswashing is affecting numerous sports and governing bodies need to respond to it far more effectively,” he added.

The Premier League declined to comment when approached by CNN.

After emerging from his darkness retreat, it’s still not known what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will do in the future, saying in an interview that he will “make a decision soon enough.”

“It’s best for anybody who has an interest in this to make a decision sooner rather than later,” Rodgers said in an interview on the Aubrey Marcus Podcast.

“I remember when (Brett) Favre, before he retired, there were times where it was in April and May, we weren’t sure if he was going to come back because he didn’t come to any of the offseason program.

“Then in 2008, he actually did retire in March and then kind of said, ‘No, no, no,’ in June after OTAs, ‘I actually want to come back and play.’ That’s when he was traded to the Jets. There was obviously a lot of tension that summer.

“For everybody involved, directly and indirectly, it’s best for a decision earlier.”

Earlier this month, Rodgers announced he was heading to a “darkness retreat” shortly after the Super Bowl.

He said he would be in total darkness for four days and nights – though he could leave at any point if he wished to do so – and added that the whole experience could produce hallucinations similar to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

Rodgers said his time in isolation would help him find inner peace of mind as he decided on his future in the NFL.

In the interview since leaving the retreat, he went on to say that he’s not looking for someone to tell him what the answer is.

“All the answers are right inside me,” he said. “I touched many of them, and definitely the feelings, on both sides, during the darkness, and I’m thankful for that time.

“There’s a finality to the decision. I don’t make it lightly. I don’t want to drag anybody around. Look, I’m answering questions about it because I get asked about it. I’m talking about it because it’s important to me.

“If you don’t like it and you think it’s drama, you think I’m being a diva or whatever, then just tune it out. That’s fine.

“But this is my life. It’s important to me, and I’ll make a decision soon enough, and then we’ll go down that road and be really excited about it.”"," After emerging from his darkness retreat, it’s still not known what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will do in the future, saying in an interview that he will “make a decision soon enough.”“It’s best for anybody who has an interest in this to make a decision sooner rather than later,” Rodgers said in an interview on the Aubrey Marcus Podcast.“I remember when (Brett) Favre, before he retired, there were times where it was in April and May, we weren’t sure if he was going to come back because he didn’t come to any of the offseason program.“Then in 2008, he actually did retire in March and then kind of said, ‘No, no, no,’ in June after OTAs, ‘I actually want to come back and play.’ That’s when he was traded to the Jets. There was obviously a lot of tension that summer.“For everybody involved, directly and indirectly, it’s best for a decision earlier.”Darkness retreatEarlier this month, Rodgers announced he was heading to a “darkness retreat” shortly after the Super Bowl.He said he would be in total darkness for four days and nights – though he could leave at any point if he wished to do so – and added that the whole experience could produce hallucinations similar to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT).Rodgers said his time in isolation would help him find inner peace of mind as he decided on his future in the NFL.In the interview since leaving the retreat, he went on to say that he’s not looking for someone to tell him what the answer is.“All the answers are right inside me,” he said. “I touched many of them, and definitely the feelings, on both sides, during the darkness, and I’m thankful for that time.“There’s a finality to the decision.

French soccer legend Just Fontaine, who still holds the record for most goals scored by a player at a single World Cup, has died aged 89, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced.

The former striker scored 13 goals in six matches at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, putting him joint-fourth alongside Lionel Messi on the all-time top scorers list, as France finished the tournament in third place.

It is considered one of the greatest records in international soccer, with no player coming close to matching it in the 65 years since it was set.

“The death of Just Fontaine plunges French football into deep emotion and immense sadness,” FFF interim president Philippe Diallo said in a statement. “Just Fontaine left his mark on football in France and abroad.

“He was an emblematic figure, with an incredible record of 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup. He wrote one of the most beautiful pages of the history of the French national team.”

Fontaine won the French league with Reims three times and once with Nice, while also picking up two French Cup titles during an illustrious career.

His exploits at the 1958 World Cup earned him third place on in the Ballon d’Or that year.

Fontaine was also part of the Reims side that reached the European Cup final in 1959, where it eventually lost out to the great Real Madrid team of that time.

“A star of French football, an unmatched goalscorer, a Reims legend,” former club Stade de Reims said. “The SDR sends its sincere condolences to his family and friends.”

Current French national team head coach Didier Deschamps said: “The death of Just Fontaine makes me sad, as it will make all of those who love football and our national team sad. ‘Justo’ is and will remain a legend of the French national team.”

Fontaine was born in Morocco and played for Moroccan club Casablanca before moving to France, where he would spend three seasons with Nice and then six with Reims.

He was eventually forced to retire early at the age of just 28 due to injury and went on to coach the French and Moroccan national team and Paris Saint-Germain, earning promotion to the French first division in 1974.

He finished his international career with 30 goals in just 21 games and in 2004, Pele named Fontaine on his list of the 125 greatest living footballers."," French soccer legend Just Fontaine, who still holds the record for most goals scored by a player at a single World Cup, has died aged 89, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced.The former striker scored 13 goals in six matches at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, putting him joint-fourth alongside Lionel Messi on the all-time top scorers list, as France finished the tournament in third place.It is considered one of the greatest records in international soccer, with no player coming close to matching it in the 65 years since it was set.“The death of Just Fontaine plunges French football into deep emotion and immense sadness,” FFF interim president Philippe Diallo said in a statement. “Just Fontaine left his mark on football in France and abroad.Just Fontaine poses with a trophy for the 1958 football World Cup top-scorer award.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

21,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/motorsport/fernando-alonso-formula-one-aston-martin-spt-intl,"CNN —

More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,” the Spaniard said ahead of the season’s start.

“There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.”

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport’s history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso’s fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans’ 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

“The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,” he says of Aston Martin’s “wonderful project.”

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”

“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”

While Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again."," More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells  Sport’s Amanda Davies.“It has to be an ambitious project.

Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport’s history.Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.Aston Martin is Alonso’s fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans’ 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.Alonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006. Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesThree years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.“The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,” he says of Aston Martin’s “wonderful project.”The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.With the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.2023 season set for more controversiesThe 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling  Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”Alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1. Frank Augstein/APWhen asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”While Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.He is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.",,"Aston Martin, Saudi, F1, New, Stroll, Lance, Bahrain","Fernando Alonso, Alpine, Aston Martin, Sport, Amanda, Michael Schumacher, Kimi Räikkönen, Lewis Hamilton, Sebastien Vettel, Alonso, F1.Aston Martin, Mark, Lawrence, Red Bull, Ferrari, Max Verstappen, Basically, Frank, Liberty, Stefano Domenicali","Formula One, Bahrain Grand, Spaniard, IndyCar Series, Le Mans, Dakar Rally, Toyota Hilux, Silverstone, FIA","Formula,One,Alpine,Sport,’s,Amanda,Davies,Sebastien,Vettel,F1.Aston,Martin,Alonso,Toyota,Championship,Lance,Silverstone,Red,Bull,Ferrari,FIA","Saudi, Arabia, Bahrain","Fernando, Alonso, Aston, Martin, Michael, Schumacher, Kimi, Räikkönen, Lewis, Hamilton, the, Dakar, Rally, Mark, Thompson, /, Getty, ’s, Lawrence, Stroll, Max, Verstappen, Frank, Augstein, Stefano, Domenicali",

Jerry Richardson, the founder and former owner of the Carolina Panthers died at the age of 86 on Wednesday night, the team announced. The team did not reveal the cause of death.

Richardson, who was a halfback at Wofford College, was the 154th player selected in the 1958 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts. However, he retired following his second season in the league over a money dispute and returned to Spartanburg, South Carolina where he started a career in business.

Richardson became the first former NFL player to own a team since George Halas when the league awarded Carolina a franchise in 1993. The Panthers inaugural season was in 1995.

In December 2017, Richardson announced that he would sell his principal stake after the team started investigating him for “workplace misconduct.”

In 2018, David Tepper, founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, agreed to purchase the team for a reported $2.2 billion, according to the Charlotte Observer.

“Jerry Richardson’s contributions to professional football in the Carolinas are historic,” Panthers owners David and Nicole Tepper said in a statement. “With the arrival of the Panthers in 1995, he changed the landscape of sports in the region and gave the NFL fans here a team to call their own.

“He was incredibly gracious to me when I purchased the team, and for that I am thankful. Nicole and I extend our deepest condolences to Rosalind, the entire Richardson family, and their loved ones. We wish them much peace and comfort.”

Under Richardson, the Panthers reached two Super Bowls and three NFC title games."," Jerry Richardson, the founder and former owner of the Carolina Panthers died at the age of 86 on Wednesday night, the team announced.

23,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/01/sport/antonio-tiberi-cycling-cat-death-san-marino-spt-intl,"CNN —

A court in San Marino has fined Italian professional cyclist Antonio Tiberi 4,000 euros (around $4,250) after he pleaded guilty to shooting a cat belonging to the tiny republic’s minister of tourism, Federico Pedini Amati, a court spokesperson confirmed to CNN.

Tiberi, an Italian who lives in San Marino, also risks losing his residency status after the conviction.

He admitted to testing out an air rifle he purchased last June by aiming at the head of the cat belonging to his neighbor, Amati, according to the court. The cat immediately died in the incident.

The 21-year-old Tiberi, who won a time trial bronze at the Junior European Road Championships in 2018 and a time trial gold at the Junior Road World Championships in 2019, apologized for the incident on Twitter.

“I deeply regret my shameful actions,” he wrote in a statement.

“I did something tremendously stupid and irresponsible, the seriousness and danger of which I realized only after the act. I don’t want to make excuses.”

Tiberi added that he would donate his prize money from this season’s winnings to animal welfare organizations in San Marino, as well as volunteering with those organizations in person.

His Trek-Segafredo team also tweeted a response, condemning Tiberi for his actions and announcing that it would suspend him for a minimum of 20 days without pay, which will include three races in Italy.

The team said it would donate Tiberi’s suspended pay to an appropriate animal care, protection and rescue organization.

“Trek-Segafredo would like to reiterate its great disappointment in Antonio’s conduct,” the statement said. “The team strives to help riders improve not just as athletes, but as men and women.

“The team will work closely with Antonio to ensure he educates himself and expects him to take necessary steps to express his remorse and become a better person.”

Pedini Amati told Italy’s Corriere Della Sera newspaper that the cat was a beloved pet of his three-year-old daughter, Lucia, who “loved it.”

He condemned the light sentence and fine and called for Tiberi’s residency to be stripped.

“You cannot kill a pet and get away with a €4,000 euro fine,” Pedini Amati said. “I appreciated that the young man admitted the fact, having said that, we do not need to give residence to these people.”

Pedini Amati did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN."," A court in San Marino has fined Italian professional cyclist Antonio Tiberi 4,000 euros (around $4,250) after he pleaded guilty to shooting a cat belonging to the tiny republic’s minister of tourism, Federico Pedini Amati, a court spokesperson confirmed to .Tiberi, an Italian who lives in San Marino, also risks losing his residency status after the conviction.He admitted to testing out an air rifle he purchased last June by aiming at the head of the cat belonging to his neighbor, Amati, according to the court.

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."," It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.“This is just the beginning.

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"," Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.Putellas collects the award for the Best FIFA Women's Player.

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."," Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket.

27,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"CNN —

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been implicated in a “kidnapping and torture” investigation in France, the Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.

This follows allegations that Al-Khelaifi was involved in the transfer of “likely compromising” documents from a French-Algerian citizen, Tayeb Benabderrahmane, who claims to have been tortured in Qatari custody in 2020, according to a complaint submitted by Benabderrahmane’s lawyers to French authorities.

“On January 19, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened a preliminary investigation into acts of kidnapping; sequestration with torture and acts of barbarism in an organized gang; extortion in an organized gang; threats and acts of intimidation and association with criminals. This followed the receipt of two complaints with civil action regarding Mr Benabderrahmane,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN but did not name Al-Khelaifi.

The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to CNN Wednesday that three investigating judges have been assigned to the case. This typically denotes a progression from the preliminary investigation.

The complaint from Benabderrahmane’s lawyers does not specify what the alleged documents are, but claims that “they were likely to be compromising for certain high-level people in Qatar, even foreigners.”

Al-Khelaifi, who is a Qatari citizen, denies any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, his representative directed CNN to a statement which they said “Al-Khelaifi issued to L’Equipe in November, 2022.”

“You are talking about professional criminals,” Al-Khelaifi said. “They’ve changed their lawyers more times than they’ve changed their stories and their lies. It is the ultimate media manipulation.

“I’m just amazed so many people have taken their lies and contradictions as credible – but that’s the media world we’re in today. Justice will run its course – I don’t have time to talk about petty professional criminals.”

Lawyers representing Benabderrahmane, Romain Ruiz and Gabriel Vejnar, told CNN on Wednesday: “Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane welcomes the opening of this investigation by the French justice system and will naturally continue to defend his rights as he has done in the other proceedings he has initiated in order to establish the seriously detrimental nature of the treatment he has been subjected to by the Qatari authorities as well as by its representatives in France and abroad.

“Mr. Benabderrahmane wishes to emphasize that, contrary to what is often asserted, he has never been implicated in extortion or blackmail against Nasser Al-Khelaifi,” Ruiz and Vejnar added."," Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been implicated in a “kidnapping and torture” investigation in France, the Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to  on Wednesday.This follows allegations that Al-Khelaifi was involved in the transfer of “likely compromising” documents from a French-Algerian citizen, Tayeb Benabderrahmane, who claims to have been tortured in Qatari custody in 2020, according to a complaint submitted by Benabderrahmane’s lawyers to French authorities.“On January 19, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened a preliminary investigation into acts of kidnapping; sequestration with torture and acts of barbarism in an organized gang; extortion in an organized gang; threats and acts of intimidation and association with criminals.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

Some parts of being a professional tennis player aren’t glamorous.

And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.

“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour? It must be so amazing!”

“Me: gets bagled on your birthday, sitting eating Doritos at midnight, waiting to get on a 16 hr flight home,” the American tweeted, alongside a selfie of her eating the crisps.

Shahida Raza, a football and hockey player who left her native Pakistan to secure medical treatment for her son, was among those killed in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy on Sunday. She was 29.

Also known as “Chinto,” Raza was a member of Pakistan’s national soccer team and previously played for the national field hockey team.

Her close friend, Sumaiya, told CNN that Raza was traveling to Europe illegally in the hope of securing a better future for her three-year-old son with a medical condition. Her family says her son was not on the boat.

“We only want her body back, nothing more,” Sumaiya said. “We have no knowledge of where her body is. No one is giving us any information or telling us what to do.”

At least 64 people died when a wooden boat carrying migrants from Turkey broke apart on rocks off the coast of Calabria on Sunday, at least two of whom were Pakistani nationals.

On Thursday, a spokesperson from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that 17 Pakistani were rescued and two are still missing.

“Our Embassy in Rome remains actively engaged with the Italian authorities for the welfare of the survivors and transportation of the mortal remains of the deceased,” the spokesperson said.

Raza was a member of the minority Shia Hazara community in the city of Quetta, close to the border with Afghanistan.

She played football for Balochistan United but, despite her status as an international player, was unable to find a job in Pakistan and therefore couldn’t afford her son’s medical treatment, Sumaiya said.

Raza was afraid of water and not even her family were aware of her decision to move to another country, Sumaiya added.

The Shia Hazara community in Pakistan has faced years of persecution by Sunni militant groups in the country.

After a deadly attack in Quetta four years ago, Amnesty International called for further protection for a community who “have suffered many such tragedies over several years. Each time, there are promises that more will be done to protect them, and each time those promises have failed to materialize.”

Tributes have been paid to Raza following her death, including from Aurat March, a prominent women’s right movement in Pakistan, and members of the country’s hockey federation, who “expressed their condolences” to Raza’s family.

According to the International Hockey Federation, Raza made six appearances for Pakistan in 2013.

The ill-fated boat had left the Turkish city of Izmir three or four days before the wreck and the first three bodies washed up on the beach near Staccato di Cutro in southern Italy around 4:40 a.m. local time on Sunday.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni blamed human traffickers for the shipwreck, saying it is “criminal to launch a boat just 20 meters long with 200 people on board in adverse weather.”

Meloni has made stopping migrant boats a priority for her right-wing government.

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from this week’s BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, the tournament announced on Sunday, suggesting that his visa application to enter the United States had been unsuccessful.

Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, said last month that he had hoped for a “positive result” on being able to receive special permission to play tournaments in the US, where international visitors must be vaccinated in order to gain entry.

Georgian player Nikoloz Basilashvili has taken Djokovic’s place in the draw.

Speaking to reporters on Friday after his defeat against Daniil Medvedev in Dubai, the Australian Open champion said he was “still waiting for the news from America.”

He added: “If there’s no America, I guess I’ll play clay. Monte Carlo is probably the next tournament. If that’s the case, I’ll take some time off, I’ll prepare.”

CNN has contacted Djokovic’s representatives for comment on his withdrawal from Indian Wells but did not receive a response.

The tournament begins on Monday and concludes on March 19.

Last week, the US Open said in a tweet that Djokovic is one of the “greatest champions our sport has ever seen,” adding that organizers of the grand slam were “hopeful” his petition to enter the country would be successful.

Djokovic began the year by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas to win the Australian Open, equaling Rafael Nadal’s record of 22 grand slam singles titles in the men’s all-time list.

He could surpass Nadal’s record at the French Open later this year, though the Spaniard will be looking to defend his title as he continues his recovery from injury."," World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from this week’s BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, the tournament announced on Sunday, suggesting that his visa application to enter the United States had been unsuccessful.Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, said last month that he had hoped for a “positive result” on being able to receive special permission to play tournaments in the US, where international visitors must be vaccinated in order to gain entry.Georgian player Nikoloz Basilashvili has taken Djokovic’s place in the draw.Speaking to reporters on Friday after his defeat against Daniil Medvedev in Dubai, the Australian Open champion said he was “still waiting for the news from America.”He added: “If there’s no America, I guess I’ll play clay.

1,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,"CNN —

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/Netflix

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"," It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells  Sport.“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Reiner Bajo/NetflixFirst portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012. Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesThe experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed. Reiner Bajo/NetflixWhether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”",Western Front,"Scotland, Germany, Bäumer, Russian, Ukraine, German, French, Costa Rica, Birmingham, Alabama, Scottish, California","Lesley Paterson, Paterson, Erich Maria Remarque, Paul Bäumer, Reiner, Quiet, Ian Stokell, Netflix, Great Britain, Kevin, Sam Mendes, Edward Berger, Malte Grunert","First, Scottish Highlands, Armistice Talks, BAFTA, Oscars, XTERRA","BAFTA,XTERRA","Scotland, Germany, Ukraine, Hollywood, Netflix, Costa, Rica, Great, Britain, Birmingham, Alabama, California","Lesley, Paterson, Oscar, Erich, Maria, Remarque, ’s, Paul, Bäumer, Felix, Kammerer, Reiner, Bajo, /, NetflixFirst, Ian, Stokell, Kevin, C., Cox, Getty, NetflixWhether, Sam, Mendes, Edward, Berger, Malte, Grunert",

UEFA plans to refund all Liverpool supporters who had tickets for the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris, the governing body of European soccer announced on Tuesday.

Last year’s final was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.

There was widespread criticism about the way fans were treated at the game, with UK Member of Parliament Ian Byrne – who was at the match as a Liverpool fan – describing the situation outside the stadium as “one of the most horrendous experiences of my life.”

A UEFA statement on the refund said: “UEFA will implement a special refund scheme for fans who were most affected when accessing the Stade de France on 28 May 2022.

“Refunds will be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z where the most difficult circumstances were reported.

“Given these criteria, the special refund scheme covers all of the Liverpool FC ticket allocation for the Final, i.e. 19,618 tickets.”

UEFA noted that Real Madrid fans and neutral supporters affected while accessing the stadium can also claim refunds, depending on whether they meet the criteria.

An independent review commissioned by UEFA found that the organization bears “primary responsibility” for circumstances which almost caused the event to turn into a “mass fatality catastrophe.”

“We recognize the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and, with this scheme, we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium,” UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said.

“We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair.

“We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organizations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period,” Theodoridis added.

Spirit of Shankly (SOS) issued a statement in conjunction with the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Society, reading: “We welcome today’s announcement from UEFA. This unprecedented move is the result of tireless work, alongside FSE (Football Supporters Europe) and Ian Byrne MP, to hold those responsible for the catastrophic events in Paris.

“With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledging their part in the fiasco. But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."," After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.Krejčíková embraces Świątek after winning the final.

A supporter of English football club Blackpool has died after an altercation took place between fans on Saturday.

According to Lancashire Police, Tony Johnson, 55, suffered a serious head injury when a fight broke out between Blackpool and Burnley fans. The fight occurred outside a pub in Blackpool at around 7 p.m. local time.

Officers administered CPR to Johnson at the scene, police said, before he was taken to hospital.

“Sadly Mr Johnson died in hospital overnight and his family are, understandably, devastated,” Detective Chief Inspector Tracey McMurdo of Lancashire Police said in a statement on Monday.

“We are supporting them at this difficult time and are determined to get them answers about what happened. The investigation continues and we will pursue anybody involved to bring them to justice.”

A 33-year-old man from Burnley was arrested at the scene on suspicion of wounding and he has since been bailed until June 1, according to the Lancashire Police statement.

Police have also appealed for anyone with footage of the incident to come forward and refrain from posting it on social media.

In a statement on Monday, Blackpool said the club is “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the news that supporter, Tony Johnson, tragically lost his life earlier this morning,” adding that “all of the thoughts of everyone at the football club go out to Tony’s family and friends.”

The club is also inviting fans to honor Johnson, a lifelong Blackpool fan, by laying flowers at its stadium, Bloomfield Road, on Monday.

Blackpool and Burnley both play in the Championship, English football’s second tier.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

Llopis, who the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA) said was a medal contender in the race, collided with the final hurdle and fell awkwardly, appearing to hit his head on the track.

The 22-year-old lay motionless on the track before being attended to by medical staff, who held up a white sheet to shield Llopis from view as he received treatment.

Llopis was then stretchered from the track in a neck brace and taken to hospital, where he later appeared in a video posted to the RFEA Twitter account.

For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.

Or at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.

The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.



It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it’s a ratio he is more than content with.

“Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It’s the pinnacle of our sport, it’s what you’re judged by,” Koepka told CNN.

“If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can’t tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person’s won or that person’s won, but they know exactly how many majors you’ve won.

“So, to me, that’s what you’re defined by.”

‘I love it when athletes get cocky’

They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.

Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It’s a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.

“I’m pretty blunt, I don’t like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I’ve always been that way,” he said. “I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that’s how I feel.

“I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves – I think that’s important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you’re doing.

“If you feel you’re the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.”

And Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.

Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.

Koepka’s current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 – albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.

Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had “dislocated and shattered” his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.

His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix’s new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series “Full Swing,” where Koepka admitted his slump was “the worst” he had ever suffered in his life.

“There was a lot of stuff … just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,” Koepka told CNN.

“The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you’re just sitting there. There’s a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you’ve just got to endure, just to make it better. It’s not always fun, not always glamorous.”

Health is wealth

Yet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.

Alongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner’s earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.

“To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable … something I can really, really look back on,” Koepka said.

“I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year – I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.

“Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that’s the goal.”

Naturally though, that isn’t Koepka’s only goal for 2023. A self-confessed “slow starter,” he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.

Runner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a “good” 2023.

“Hopefully a few wins, and then a major – that’s the goal every year,” he said."," For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.Or at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it’s a ratio he is more than content with.“Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It’s the pinnacle of our sport, it’s what you’re judged by,” Koepka told .“If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can’t tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person’s won or that person’s won, but they know exactly how many majors you’ve won.“So, to me, that’s what you’re defined by.”‘I love it when athletes get cocky’They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It’s a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.“I’m pretty blunt, I don’t like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I’ve always been that way,” he said. “I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that’s how I feel.“I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves – I think that’s important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you’re doing.“If you feel you’re the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.”Koepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019. Ross Kinnaird/Getty ImagesAnd Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.Koepka’s current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 – albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had “dislocated and shattered” his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix’s new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series “Full Swing,” where Koepka admitted his slump was “the worst” he had ever suffered in his life.“There was a lot of stuff … just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,” Koepka told .“The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you’re just sitting there. There’s a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you’ve just got to endure, just to make it better. It’s not always fun, not always glamorous.”Koepka struggled for form during 2022.

Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk refused to shake hands with her Russian opponent Varvara Gracheva after claiming victory in the final of the ATX Open in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.

Kostyuk defeated Gracheva 6-3 7-5, collapsing to the court after converting match point, before refusing to shake hands with the Russian.

The 20-year-old, who is from Kyiv, said at January’s Australian Open that she would not shake hands with any Russian or Belarusian opponent with war raging in her country.

She refused to shake hands with Victoria Azarenka of Belarus at the US Open in September last year. Belarus is being used as a key staging ground for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Kostyuk dedicated her maiden WTA singles title to her native country during the trophy presentation.

“Being in the position that I am in right now, it’s extremely special to win this title,” Kostyuk said.

“And I want to dedicate this title to Ukraine and to all the people that are fighting and dying right now.”

Kostyuk did not acknowledge the beaten finalist in her acceptance speech.

The tournament win, the first for a Ukrainian woman since Elina Svitolina in 2021, elevated Kostyuk to No. 40 in the WTA rankings.

Among the grand slams, only Wimbledon has banned Russian and Belarusian players from competing, leading to a $1 million fine by the men’s tour.

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"," Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.Putellas collects the award for the Best FIFA Women's Player.

More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,” the Spaniard said ahead of the season’s start.

“There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.”

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport’s history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso’s fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans’ 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

“The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,” he says of Aston Martin’s “wonderful project.”

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”

“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”

While Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesA long roadTensions started to emerge in 2019.A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.IBA president Umar Kremlev speaks at a press conference ahead of the 2023 Women World Boxing Championship. Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesIBA makes surprise announcementOn Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.(Left to right) Silver medalist Pat McCormack, gold medalist Cuba's Roniel Iglesias and bronze medalists Russian Olympic Committee's Andrei Zamkovoi and Ireland's Aidan Walsh celebrate on the podium after the men's welterweight boxing final at the 2020 Olympics.

Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag stood on the touchline with a face like thunder as he watched his team fall apart against Liverpool on Sunday.

The Dutchman had been praised for turning around the club’s fortunes ahead of the Premier League tie against its fierce rival, but the 7-0 drubbing that followed showed there was still some way to go.

Following the humiliation – the team’s worst league loss since 1931 – ten Hag did not hold back on his team.

“It was not about one or two players. It was the whole team; you saw 11 individuals losing their heads,” Ten Hag told reporters after the game.

“That is unprofessional, that is not Manchester United. We have other standards, these were not the standards we want to show.

“Every defeat, no matter what, is worse, especially when you lose at Liverpool. We let the fans down so that is the most annoying.”

Despite finding itself 1-0 down at the break, United had initially coped well with the Anfield atmosphere and was very much in the game as the second half kicked off.

Shortly after the restart though, Liverpool began pulling away and United’s players seemed to give up as the host went for the jugular.

Braces from Cody Gakpo, Darwin Núñez and Mo Salah, plus Roberto Firmino’s late goal, secured the utterly dominant win and it’s no surprise that many of United’s traveling fans had left the stadium before the final whistle.

Meanwhile, some of United’s senior players lost discipline and failed to track Liverpool’s unrelenting forward runs on multiple occasions.

“For the [fans] who stayed, it was tough, and we really have to thank them,” ten Hag added.

“I can’t blame those who go away because it was a really bad performance. Devastating and we let the fans down.”

‘Freak result’

While United’s players were left licking their wounds after a punishing day, Liverpool were basking in the glow of a memorable result.

Manager Jurgen Klopp, who has struggled to get a tune out of his team this season, was all smiles as he spoke to the media after the game.

“Freak result, top performance. A really top performance from the start, I thought the way we started the game was really special, the best for a long, long time,” he told reporters.

“I don’t think the second half could start better […] and from that moment on, the boys were flying. Then it was really difficult to play against us.”

Klopp also saved special praise for Salah who became Liverpool’s top Premier League scorer with his second effort.

“[He] achieved something really, really special – we should not forget that just because we are used to him scoring a lot of goals,” Klopp added.

“Very special, very special player, very special boy and [he] should be really proud of that.”

Now on 129 league goals, Salah overtakes legendary striker Robbie Fowler having played 61 fewer games.

Salah himself admitted the record was very special to him but said he wouldn’t get carried away with the achievement.

“It’s very special, I can’t lie,” he told reporters. “This record was in my mind since I came here.

“I think after my first season I was always chasing that record. To beat it today against United with that result is unbelievable.

“I’m going home to celebrate with the family, have a camomile tea and sleep.”

Despite the result, United still sits seven points ahead of Liverpool in the league, but the latter moves just three points behind Tottenham in the fourth and final Champions League place with a game in hand.

Ten Hag will be hoping his side is resilient enough to shake off the disappointment as it faces Real Betis in the Europa League on Thursday."," Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag stood on the touchline with a face like thunder as he watched his team fall apart against Liverpool on Sunday.The Dutchman had been praised for turning around the club’s fortunes ahead of the Premier League tie against its fierce rival, but the 7-0 drubbing that followed showed there was still some way to go.Following the humiliation – the team’s worst league loss since 1931 – ten Hag did not hold back on his team.“It was not about one or two players.

Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.

If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.

“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we’re going to have more of that.”

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.

“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.

“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.

Ahead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.

“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.

“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.

“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.

“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”

Homa’s ‘rant’

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.

“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.

“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.”"," Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles.

When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”Homa’s ‘rant’Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.While he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Michael Reaves/Getty Images“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys.

Minnesota Vikings’ star KJ Osborn says he and three other people helped save a man who was trapped inside a burning car in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.

“Most of the time the saying goes ‘wrong place wrong time.’ But this time I believe God had me, us, at the right place at the exact right time,” third-year wide receiver Osborn said in a Twitter post on Monday.

“Last night myself and these 3 absolute hero’s helped save a man’s life by rescuing him from a vehicle up in flames after a bad crash. A situation I’d never imagine being apart of in a million years.

“I’ll leave you with this. God is real. And His LOVE is real. He will send his angels to be camped around you and provide you with his grace and mercy.”

Osborn posted several photos of the disturbing scene. One showed a burning car with what appears to be a man aiding a person inside.

Another is a photo of the aftermath of the wrecked and scorched vehicle. And a third of himself, and the three other people who he says helped the man escape the burning wreck.

CNN has reached out to the Austin police department but did not immediately hear back.

Osborn spoke about the incident on ESPN’s Adam Schefter’s podcast, saying: “I’m on my way home, I’m on the back of an Uber, and my head is down and I’m on my phone, just on my way home.

“My Uber driver just starts going crazy. He’s like, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I look up, and I’m wondering what’s all the fuss about and there’s nobody on the street.

“He’s like, ‘This guy crashed,’ and I look to my right and there’s a car, if you were to picture it, under a bridge’s pillars. His car is head-on. He hit the pillar and his car is in flames.”

The 25-year-old, who was chosen in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft out of the University of Miami, said his Uber driver exited the car and insisted they call 911.

The driver then ran up to the car door, and Osborn followed. After initial hesitation, Osborn said he and the driver, with the help of two others on the scene, then pulled the man out the vehicle, picked him up and carried him to safety then waited with him until emergency medical services, firefighters and the police arrived.

Osborn, who is training in Austin, says he has been in contact with the man and intends to visit him at the hospital, together with the three others who helped save him. He added that he believes the man only suffered minor injuries.

“I’m just grateful that I was in the position to be able to help him as well as the three other heroes to be there.”

16,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"CNN —

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

This is very important for me,” said Hamed.The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.The president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022. Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told  Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.Infrastructure projectsThe football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022. Alaa Badarneh/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockGeneral Secretary of the PFA Hilal told  Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”Coach Daboub goes even further.“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said.","West Bank,Gaza City,East Jerusalem,Gaza Strip,Gaza,West,West Asian","Palestinian, Palestine, Portugal, African, Middle East, Israel, Palestinians, Palestianian, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, United, Arabic, Israeli, Tubas, Nablus, Hamas, Jerusalem, Japan, United States, Singapore, Canaan, Tunisian, Egyptian, Entry, Asian, Egypt, Qatar, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Spanish, Ramallah, Portuguese, North Korea, Jiangyin, China, Gao, European, Arouca, Belgian, Bethlehem, Tel Aviv, Asia","Arab, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Nakba, Arab Emirates, Ulrik, Rami Hamadeh, Ahmed Daraghmeh, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud Sarsak, Mahmud, Sarsak, Mongolia, Jabal, Bnei, Jibril Rajoub, Henley, Suhaib, Makram Daboub, Daboub, Arab Cup, Gianni Infantino, Ismail El Haddad, Yaser Hamed, Hamed, Spain, Thomas Bach, Issam, Rajoub, Firas Abu Hilal, Shaheen, Shaheen., Sports, Dabbagh, Song Kum Song, Jiangsu, Portugal, Alaa, Hilal., Abu, Morocco","Qatar, Atlas Lions, Hamadeh, Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, AFC Asian, IDF, Reuters, Islamic Jihad, Philippines, IDs, PFA, AP, Partners, FIFA, AFC, WAFF, FA Jibril, IOC, General, National, projectsThe, IFA, Futsal Hall, Faisal, Palestine, PFA Hilal, UEFA","the,Atlas,Lions,AFC,Asian,Cup,Tubas,Israel,Defense,Forces,IDF,Reuters,Hamas,Al,-,Shifa,Islamic,Jihad,Palestinian,Football,Association,AP,Henley,&,Partners,FIFA,Suhaib,Salem,ReutersThe,Visa,The,Confederation,West,Federation,WAFF,IOC,Issam,Rimawi,/,Anadolu,Agency,Getty,ImagesThe,PFA,National,Olympic,Committee,“To,Oday,Dabbagh,F.C.,Arouca,R.,Charleroi,S.C,’s,IFA,FIFA.They,Palestine,Ram,Hilal,football,association,UEFA,World,Cup,”Coach,Daboub","Qatar, Portugal, Israel, the, West, Bank, Gaza, East, Jerusalem, Abu, Dhabi, United, Arab, Emirates, Nablus, City, Philippines, Mongolia, Yemen, Strip, London, Japan, States, forfeit, Singapore, Daboub, The, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi, Arabia, Spain, Palestine, Ramallah, North, Korea, Jiangyin, city, China, Jiangsu, Bethlehem, Tel, Aviv, boycotts, Asian, Cups","Rami, Hamadeh, Jordan, Ulrik, Pedersen, /, CSM, Zuma, Sports, Ahmed, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud, Sarsak, Mahmud, Hams, AFP, Getty, ImagesPalestinian, Jabal, Al, -, Mukaber, Bnei, Sakhnin, Gazan, Makram, Daboub, Gianni, Infantino, Ismail, El, Haddad, Yaser, Hamed, Thomas, Bach, Firas, Abu, Hilal, Diala, Shaheen, Song, Kum, Gao, meng, Imaginechina, APDabbagh, Faisal, Husseini, Stadium, Jibril, Rajoub, Alaa, Badarneh","the, Middle, East, Asia"

Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players’ every need is taken care of. If so, think again.

In a survey published by the NFL Players’ Association (NFLPA) on Wednesday, 1,300 players provided feedback on the league’s 32 teams, which were then ranked in a variety of categories.

Look away now if you’re a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Washington Commanders.

NFL players rated teams in the NFLPA’s “Club Report Cards” survey based on their treatment of families, nutrition, weight room, strength and conditioning staff, training room, training staff and locker room. They also provided feedback specific to each team.

The Minnesota Vikings were ranked as the best overall: the NFLPA report pointing to the franchise’s newly built, state-of-the-art facility, calling the team a “shining example of what is possible when a concerted investment is made in both staffing and facilities.”

The Miami Dolphins came second, with the only critique being that players would “like a better post-game family area with more accessibility for players’ families.” The Las Vegas Raiders finished third.

At the other end of the scale, the Chargers, Cardinals and Commanders comprised the bottom three.

The Commanders finished last, with the franchise handed an F-minus for their training room, locker room and team travel, while also getting an F for treatment of families.

Complaints from players included an understaffed training room, undersized hot and cold tubs for player recovery, not enough personal space in the locker room and lack of warm water and issues with poor drainage in the showers.

The Chargers and Cardinals didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Commanders said: “Player health and safety is our top priority, and we continue to invest in our facilities, including a new practice field, new turf in the practice bubble and increased meeting room space. We know there is more to do, and we regularly talk with our players about ways to improve their work environment and the experience for their families.”

Over one-fifth of players surveyed – 22% – also felt they didn’t have enough space on team flights, with the Commanders one of seven teams in the NFL that apparently don’t offer their players first-class seats.

The Cardinals ranked last in terms of food, with players complaining that they were charged for food at the facility, reportedly the only team to do so.

The team was also criticized heavily for the low standard of its facilities, with some complaining the weight room feels like a “safety hazard.”

Players labeled the Chargers’ hot and cold tubs “gross.”

Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars appear to have a bit of a rodent problem.

“When asked what the number one thing they want changed at their facility, the answer was unanimous – get rid of the rats! Players reported that for 3-4 weeks this season, there was a rat infestation in the locker room and laundry hampers,” the report said.

The Jaguars didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of three teams that do not provide dinner to their players and are the only team that doesn’t provide supplements. They are also the only team that does not have outlets in their lockers to charge devices.

The rankings aren’t necessarily an indication of success on the field though, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs coming in at 29th.

The objective of the “Club Report Cards” was to help provide “players with information about each club to not only help them make important career decisions, but also try and raise standards across each club,” according to NFLPA president JC Tretter.

“One of our core jobs as a union is to improve the overall working conditions for our players,” added Tretter.

“Often, you see our advocacy on ‘big’ issues – like our push for better field surfaces at stadiums or standardized safety protocols that limit the risk of workplace injuries – but it also includes the daily experience of players at the team facilities away from the lights and cameras,” he said."," Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players’ every need is taken care of.

Boston Red Sox third baseman Justin Turner is resting at home after he was hit in the face by a pitch which required 16 stitches.

Turner was hit by a fastball from Detroit Tigers pitcher Matt Manning in the bottom of the first inning during Monday’s game.

In an ugly scene, the 38-year-old lay on the ground with blood coming from his face before being helped away by members of Boston’s medical team.

After the game, the Red Sox said the two-time All-Star had been taken to a local hospital.

“He is receiving treatment for soft tissue injuries and is being monitored for a concussion,” the statement said. “He will undergo further testing, and we’ll update as we have more information. Justin is stable, alert and in good spirits given the circumstances.”

Turner later reposted an Instagram story from his wife which gave an update on his condition.

“Thank you to everyone that reached out about Justin and sent prayers,” Kourtney Turner wrote. “We’re home now and he’s resting (okay – maybe listening to the replay of the game).

“16 stitches and a lot of swelling but we are thanking God for no fractures and clear scans!”

Manning told reporters that he plans to reach out and apologize to Turner, stressing the pitch was not intentional.

“It was a complete accident; ball just got away,” Manning said. “I got a swing and miss on a ball kind of up in the zone, so I tried to go back to it, and it just got away from me.”

The Red Sox went on to beat the Tigers 7-1.

Turner joined the Red Sox in January, signing a reported two-year, $22 million deal during the offseason having spent the previous nine years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He won the World Series in 2020 with the Dodgers."," Boston Red Sox third baseman Justin Turner is resting at home after he was hit in the face by a pitch which required 16 stitches.Turner was hit by a fastball from Detroit Tigers pitcher Matt Manning in the bottom of the first inning during Monday’s game.In an ugly scene, the 38-year-old lay on the ground with blood coming from his face before being helped away by members of Boston’s medical team.After the game, the Red Sox said the two-time All-Star had been taken to a local hospital.“He is receiving treatment for soft tissue injuries and is being monitored for a concussion,” the statement said. “He will undergo further testing, and we’ll update as we have more information.

Paris Saint-Germain will be without star forward Neymar for the remainder of the season after it was announced the Brazilian will have to undergo surgery on his ankle injury.

Neymar was stretchered off on February 19 during PSG’s 4-3 victory over Lille after rolling his right ankle, the same injury that forced him to miss some of Brazil’s World Cup campaign.

“Neymar Jr has sustained a number of instances of instability in his right ankle in recent years,” PSG said in a statement.

“The Paris Saint-Germain medical staff recommended a ligament repair operation to avoid a major risk of recurrence. All the experts consulted have confirmed this necessity.”

PSG says it will be three to four months of recovery before Neymar can rejoin team training.

The 31-year-old has suffered a number of right ankle or foot injuries in the past, which forced him to miss six weeks of action in 2021 and Brazil’s victorious 2019 Copa América campaign.

PSG faces an uphill task to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Wednesday when it travels to Bayern Munich to try and overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit.

The team has already been knocked out of the French Cup, but has opened up an eight-point lead over Marseille at the top of Ligue 1 as it bids to win an 11th French title.

Neymar has been in fine form for PSG this season, scoring 18 goals and recording 17 assists in just 29 games in all competitions."," Paris Saint-Germain will be without star forward Neymar for the remainder of the season after it was announced the Brazilian will have to undergo surgery on his ankle injury.Neymar was stretchered off on February 19 during PSG’s 4-3 victory over Lille after rolling his right ankle, the same injury that forced him to miss some of Brazil’s World Cup campaign.“Neymar Jr has sustained a number of instances of instability in his right ankle in recent years,” PSG said in a statement.“The Paris Saint-Germain medical staff recommended a ligament repair operation to avoid a major risk of recurrence.

It was a long week and an even longer year, but Ko Jin-young is a champion once again.

Almost a year to the day since her record-shattering victory at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, the South Korean returned to Singapore to defend her crown and seal her 14th LPGA Tour victory.

After a week delayed at various points by heavy rain, Ko carded 17-under to finish two shots ahead of American Nelly Korda and become the first player in the tournament’s 15-year history to secure back-to-back wins.

It marked a cathartic return to the winner’s circle for Ko, who has struggled with a persistent wrist injury since the second half of 2022. Tears flowed almost as soon as she tapped home her closing putt for par, as the 27-year-old shared an emotional hug with caddie David Brooker.

“It’s a great honor to defend this title again. This week was too long for me but too great, so I’m so happy,” Ko told reporters.

When Ko left Singapore a year ago, she did so at the peak of her powers. The then-world No. 1 had just sealed her sixth tournament victory in her last ten starts, creating history in the process. A final round 66 marked Ko’s 15th consecutive round in the 60s, breaking Annika Sörenstam’s 16-year-old record of 14.

She returned to Sentosa Golf Club last week under wildly contrasting circumstances. In August 2022, Ko missed cuts at back-to-back events for the first time in her career, subsequently taking a seven-week break from the sport to treat a left wrist injury.

A comeback at the BMW Ladies Championship the following month ended prematurely with a withdrawal, followed up by another missed cut at the Pelican Women’s Championship. When she arrived at the CME Group Tour Championship in November, she did so as the world No. 4.

There, she told reporters that every swing hurt. Four months on, she is a champion again, toasting the “most important” win of her career.

“Because I had a tough year last year, and I fought with injury and not good game and mentally tough and everything, and then I won this week,” Ko said.

“It’s going to be more important to me and it’s going to be big momentum for me in my life.”

Raining pars

After opening with an even par 72, back-to-back 65s roared Ko into a two-shot lead over Korda heading into the final round.

A run of three straight birdies saw Korda, chasing her ninth LPGA title, cut the gap to one by the sixth hole, but a subsequent bogey – and another at the 13th – saw Ko take a healthy three-stroke cushion into the closing three holes.

An anxious wait ensued for Ko after heavy rain – having postponed action for over two hours Saturday – delayed proceedings for close to an hour, but the South Korean held her nerve to return and sink three consecutive pars to ease home with 71 and clinch the $270,000 winner’s prize.

“I [knew] Nelly [was] behind me. I thought it was just one or two shots, so it was close,” Ko said.

“But after the delay, I rested in dining, and I saw the TV and the scoreboard, and [I had] a three-shot lead. But I had two more holes left so, ‘Okay, let’s make par, play safe.’ But it was really hard to make par on 17, 18.”

Korda’s closing birdie saw her card 69, her fourth successive round in the 60s, but the world No. 2 was left to rue “silly mistakes” that undermined an ultimately strong showing in Singapore.

“Obviously, a little disappointed with today,” Korda told reporters.

“Didn’t play really well but kind of didn’t really battle as much as I wanted to. I just made a couple kind of silly mistakes here and there. It was nice to finish with a birdie and be in contention again, be in the final group feeling the emotions.”"," It was a long week and an even longer year, but Ko Jin-young is a champion once again.Almost a year to the day since her record-shattering victory at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, the South Korean returned to Singapore to defend her crown and seal her 14th LPGA Tour victory.After a week delayed at various points by heavy rain, Ko carded 17-under to finish two shots ahead of American Nelly Korda and become the first player in the tournament’s 15-year history to secure back-to-back wins.It marked a cathartic return to the winner’s circle for Ko, who has struggled with a persistent wrist injury since the second half of 2022.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"," Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells  Sports.Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

23,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/sport/nfl-calvin-ridley-gambling-reinstated-spt,"CNN —

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been reinstated after he was suspended indefinitely after gambling on NFL games during the 2021 season as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, the league said Monday.

“Ridley, who had been suspended indefinitely since March 2022 for violating the NFL’s gambling policy, is eligible to participate in all team activities, effective immediately,” officials said.

Ridley, 28, said the suspension was self-inflicted and “an isolated lapse in judgment.”

“I have always owned my mistakes and this is no different,” Ridley said in a statement. “I have great respect for the game and am excited for the opportunity to restart my career in Jacksonville. I look forward to showing my new coaches, teammates, and the entire Jaguars organization exactly who I am and what I represent as a player and person.”

Ridley’s last NFL game was October 24, 2021, after which he stepped away from football to focus on his mental health.

The Jaguars, who are scheduled to hold their first workouts of the offseason next month, welcomed the NFL’s decision.

“We look forward to building a relationship with Calvin as both an individual and as a player. Calvin is a proven playmaker and we are excited to see him compete among and with his new teammates, first during our Offseason Program in April and ultimately into the 2023 season, as we collectively pursue a championship for Jacksonville.”

Jacksonville was 9-8 last season and made the playoffs as the No. 4 seed in the AFC.

In 2022, the league said the gambling allegedly took place during a five-day period in late November 2021 while Ridley was not with the team and was away from the club’s facility on the non-football illness list.

The former Alabama standout tweeted that he “bet 1500 total” but added, “I don’t have a gambling problem.”

Subsequent tweets included him saying, “I know I was wrong But I’m getting 1 year lol” and “If you know me you know my character.”

The NFL’s investigation found no evidence that any game was compromised in any way by Ridley’s actions.

Ridley won two national championships during his time at the University of Alabama and was a first-round draft pick for the Falcons in 2018. He had 248 receptions and 28 touchdowns in 49 games in Atlanta, according to NFL.com. In 2020, he was a second team All-Pro selection.

The Falcons traded Ridley in November 2022 to the Jaguars in exchange for draft picks."," Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been reinstated after he was suspended indefinitely after gambling on NFL games during the 2021 season as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, the league said Monday.“Ridley, who had been suspended indefinitely since March 2022 for violating the NFL’s gambling policy, is eligible to participate in all team activities, effective immediately,” officials said.Ridley, 28, said the suspension was self-inflicted and “an isolated lapse in judgment.”“I have always owned my mistakes and this is no different,” Ridley said in a statement. “I have great respect for the game and am excited for the opportunity to restart my career in Jacksonville.

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."," Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket.

Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.

Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.

The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.

But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.

Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.

Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.

In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.”

CNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.

Cancellation

According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.

Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.

“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.

“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.

“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.

Benn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”

Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.

He criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.

“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”

The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”

It added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.”

It pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, “the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC’s rules (and those of UKAD).”

CNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.

‘Serious concerns’

The WBC’s February ruling stated that they had found there to be “no failures in the procedures” in relation to Benn’s sample and test.

But Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but “without explanation” was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.

According to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test – which the World Anti-Doping Agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible.

Benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October’s test, adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error.”

While Benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career, the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing.

“Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.”

Benn admitted that he’d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: “I didn’t think I’d see another day.”

“It’s hurt me,” Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. “I didn’t think I was going to make it through this period. I didn’t think I was going to make it through.”

When asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so – and it upsets me now because I don’t know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.

“I was shamed for something I hadn’t even done. … If I had done something wrong, I’m human. I’d raise my hands to it, ‘I made a mistake,’ whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.

“I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else’s incompetence. It’s been hard for the family.”

Background

At the time of Benn’s positive test last year, the bout’s promoter, Matchroom, and that organization’s boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being “prohibited” by the BBBofC.

Hearn told the BBC at the time: “As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.

“Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There’s lots going on with the lawyers.”

Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.

The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight’s money-making opportunities rather than the boxers’ safety.

Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.

Benn accused the BBBofC of conducting an “unfair and biased procedure.” He also disputes that he relinquished his license.

“(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,” a statement said on Benn’s Twitter at the time.

And a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not “engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.”"," Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.” has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.CancellationAccording to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.Benn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.He criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”It added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

28,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/sport/ja-morant-gun-taylor-jenkins-grizzlies-spt-intl,"CNN —

Police in Colorado are investigating Memphis Grizzlies All-Star guard Ja Morant after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub, authorities said Monday.

The Glendale Police Department said it’s “aware of the incident circulating on the internet involving an NBA player at a nightclub with a what appears to be a gun in the early morning hours of March 4, 2023.”

“We have confirmed the incident took place at a bar in Glendale and we are investigating the matter. The Glendale Police Department does not comment on ongoing investigations,” the department said in a statement.

The Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows the 23-year-old briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while reportedly listening to music at a nightclub, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.

Morant later apologized via his representation for the video and said he would “take some time away to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.”

The star point guard’s Instagram and Twitter accounts were deactivated soon after.

Memphis Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins had said Sunday that there is no timetable for Morant to return to the team, after the Grizzlies earlier announced the basketball player would “be away from the team for at least the next two games.”

“There’s not a definitive timeline,” Jenkins said while speaking to reporters before Sunday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

“We have said that it’ll be at least these two games. We are taking it a day at a time. This is going to be an ongoing healing process. I can’t comment on the terms of the exact timetable is going to be because this really isn’t a timetable situation.”

The league is investigating the star point guard and the video, an NBA spokesperson told CNN.

Jenkins said Morant understood he’s made some “difficult decisions and poor decisions in the past.”

“That’s why you see in his statement – it speaks for itself. He understands he’s got to get help to get to a better place, not just for himself but also for his team,” Jenkins said.

“He’s definitely embracing the mistakes that he’s made but only time will tell. We are going to support him and we are going to hold him accountable to make those changes.”

When asked about how the team felt about the video, Jenkins said they take it “very seriously.”

“There are two elements to this I want to make very clear,” Jenkins said. “There’s a supportive element. Someone that’s got to get better and needs some help. And then also there’s accountability to the team that we got to stand for.

“Obviously, nationwide – league-wide – there’s a lot of attention on gun violence. For us internally on this matter, that’s the stance we’ve taken on this about how we can support Ja throughout this growth opportunity. It’s a learning opportunity. Hopefully, we can be better from it.”

Jenkins reiterated the team will continue to support Morant through the process.

29,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/football/world-cup-final-penalty-shootout-spt-intl,"CNN —

A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it’s still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout, arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.

For the fans, it’s excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar, one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.

For the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. “Love hurts,” goes the anonymous quote, “but not as much as penalties.”

Success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates’ hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, “It’s as if, for a few seconds, a player’s soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.”

Very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can’t get enough of them.

“A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,” he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. “It’s painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!”

Professor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He’s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.

He’s studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they’re doing.

“The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,” the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never “only a lottery.”

Penalties are more important than ever

The margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it’s in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer’s biggest prizes are being decided.

“If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,” says Jordet, “you’re making a severe mistake if you’re not prepared for penalties.”

In 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.

The following year was a bonanza for penalties.

Starting in February with Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals – both against Chelsea – on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.

The 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.

Within seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He’s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.

“The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,” Jordet explained to CNN Sport. “It seems like they don’t know what to do. And then with other teams, it’s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.”

Last season’s FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

They spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea’s seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.

“He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he’s done with the plan,” Jordet observed in a tweet thread, “Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.

“There’s plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.”

Liverpool’s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.

Chelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.

World Cup Final penalty masterclass

Nobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet’s research has confirmed that the goalies aren’t just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.

In recent seasons, Argentina’s 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the “Machiavelli of football.”

Jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.

Since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, “I can tell you’re nervous. I know where you’re going to shoot. Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up. Remember, I’m going to eat you up!”

But it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.

Jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. “Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,” Jordet explained.

“He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,” a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.

For the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.

This kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?

Jordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to “fully get to work.”

Martínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.

Jordet notes that goalkeepers don’t typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.

“We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.

“In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.”

By the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.

The approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.

When the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.

Tchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.

By now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.

Martínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.

“Very calculated, creative, well executed,” Jordet concludes, “but of course also highly, highly cynical.”

Martínez showed very little remorse for his “cynical” actions. After the final he said, “”I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.”

“All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.”

Since the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.

This would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.

Shootouts don’t always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.

Jordet notes that when LAFC’s Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.

“You’re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you’re a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.”

Los Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.

The power of intangibles

Some teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.

England has lost seven of the 10 that it’s participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain’s loss to Morocco in 2022 means it’s now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.

Jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren’t involved in it, you’re more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.

Having lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty in the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.

More and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet’s consultancy business for help.

“I totally think there’s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,” Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.

“I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.”

Jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He’s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.

“I love penalty shootouts,” he says, “I think it’s the ultimate drama in football.”

And yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn’t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.

“The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you’re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.

“TV producers aren’t always my friends,” Jordet concludes, “because they don’t look at what I like to look at.”

But now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they’re missing the best bits."," A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner.

30,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,"CNN —

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

I wanted to be in attack mode.

A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it’s still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout, arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.

For the fans, it’s excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar, one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.

For the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. “Love hurts,” goes the anonymous quote, “but not as much as penalties.”

Success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates’ hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, “It’s as if, for a few seconds, a player’s soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.”

Very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can’t get enough of them.

“A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,” he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. “It’s painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!”

Professor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He’s been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.

He’s studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they’re doing.

“The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,” the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never “only a lottery.”

Penalties are more important than ever

The margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it’s in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer’s biggest prizes are being decided.

“If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,” says Jordet, “you’re making a severe mistake if you’re not prepared for penalties.”

In 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.

The following year was a bonanza for penalties.

Starting in February with Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals – both against Chelsea – on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.

The 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.

Within seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He’s able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.

“The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,” Jordet explained to CNN Sport. “It seems like they don’t know what to do. And then with other teams, it’s all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.”

Last season’s FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

They spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea’s seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.

“He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he’s done with the plan,” Jordet observed in a tweet thread, “Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.

“There’s plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.”

Liverpool’s efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.

Chelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.

World Cup Final penalty masterclass

Nobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet’s research has confirmed that the goalies aren’t just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.

In recent seasons, Argentina’s 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the “Machiavelli of football.”

Jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.

Since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, “I can tell you’re nervous. I know where you’re going to shoot. Watch and see how I’m going to eat you up. Remember, I’m going to eat you up!”

But it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.

Jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. “Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,” Jordet explained.

“He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,” a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.

For the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.

This kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?

Jordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to “fully get to work.”

Martínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.

Jordet notes that goalkeepers don’t typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.

“We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.

“In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.”

By the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.

The approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.

When the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.

Tchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.

By now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.

Martínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.

“Very calculated, creative, well executed,” Jordet concludes, “but of course also highly, highly cynical.”

Martínez showed very little remorse for his “cynical” actions. After the final he said, “”I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.”

“All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.”

Since the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.

This would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.

Shootouts don’t always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.

Jordet notes that when LAFC’s Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.

“You’re implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you’re a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.”

Los Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.

The power of intangibles

Some teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.

England has lost seven of the 10 that it’s participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain’s loss to Morocco in 2022 means it’s now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.

Jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren’t involved in it, you’re more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.

Having lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty in the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.

More and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet’s consultancy business for help.

“I totally think there’s so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,” Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.

“I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.”

Jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He’s interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.

“I love penalty shootouts,” he says, “I think it’s the ultimate drama in football.”

And yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn’t have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.

“The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you’re lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.

“TV producers aren’t always my friends,” Jordet concludes, “because they don’t look at what I like to look at.”

But now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they’re missing the best bits."," A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner.

Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.

Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.

The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.

But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.

Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.

Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.

In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.”

CNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.

Cancellation

According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.

Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.

“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.

“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.

“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.

Benn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”

Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.

He criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.

“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”

The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”

It added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.”

It pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, “the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC’s rules (and those of UKAD).”

CNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.

‘Serious concerns’

The WBC’s February ruling stated that they had found there to be “no failures in the procedures” in relation to Benn’s sample and test.

But Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but “without explanation” was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.

According to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test – which the World Anti-Doping Agency says “affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns” a positive test – to be tested as soon as possible.

Benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October’s test, adding to his belief that the result was a “testing error.”

While Benn now says that he had to concentrate on “rebuilding” his career, the process he has gone through has given him “serious concerns about the whole testing system” in boxing.

“Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.”

Benn admitted that he’d had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: “I didn’t think I’d see another day.”

“It’s hurt me,” Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. “I didn’t think I was going to make it through this period. I didn’t think I was going to make it through.”

When asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so – and it upsets me now because I don’t know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.

“I was shamed for something I hadn’t even done. … If I had done something wrong, I’m human. I’d raise my hands to it, ‘I made a mistake,’ whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.

“I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else’s incompetence. It’s been hard for the family.”

Background

At the time of Benn’s positive test last year, the bout’s promoter, Matchroom, and that organization’s boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being “prohibited” by the BBBofC.

Hearn told the BBC at the time: “As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.

“Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There’s lots going on with the lawyers.”

Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.

The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight’s money-making opportunities rather than the boxers’ safety.

Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.

Benn accused the BBBofC of conducting an “unfair and biased procedure.” He also disputes that he relinquished his license.

“(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,” a statement said on Benn’s Twitter at the time.

And a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not “engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.”"," Conor Benn’s scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing’s drugs testing protocols.The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his “highly-elevated consumption of eggs” prior to testing offered a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that “the manner in which I’ve been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.” has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.CancellationAccording to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels “by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.” The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was “grateful for the ultimate finding” of being declared “innocent of being a drugs cheat,” he couldn’t sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.“It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,” he wrote.“At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,” Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.“As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,” he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.Benn added: “However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.”Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.He criticized the BBCofC’s handling of his case in his statement.“As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.”The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not “party to the review” and had not seen “any evidence provided on Mr. Benn’s behalf.”It added that while “it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body.

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been reinstated after he was suspended indefinitely after gambling on NFL games during the 2021 season as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, the league said Monday.

“Ridley, who had been suspended indefinitely since March 2022 for violating the NFL’s gambling policy, is eligible to participate in all team activities, effective immediately,” officials said.

Ridley, 28, said the suspension was self-inflicted and “an isolated lapse in judgment.”

“I have always owned my mistakes and this is no different,” Ridley said in a statement. “I have great respect for the game and am excited for the opportunity to restart my career in Jacksonville. I look forward to showing my new coaches, teammates, and the entire Jaguars organization exactly who I am and what I represent as a player and person.”

Ridley’s last NFL game was October 24, 2021, after which he stepped away from football to focus on his mental health.

The Jaguars, who are scheduled to hold their first workouts of the offseason next month, welcomed the NFL’s decision.

“We look forward to building a relationship with Calvin as both an individual and as a player. Calvin is a proven playmaker and we are excited to see him compete among and with his new teammates, first during our Offseason Program in April and ultimately into the 2023 season, as we collectively pursue a championship for Jacksonville.”

Jacksonville was 9-8 last season and made the playoffs as the No. 4 seed in the AFC.

In 2022, the league said the gambling allegedly took place during a five-day period in late November 2021 while Ridley was not with the team and was away from the club’s facility on the non-football illness list.

The former Alabama standout tweeted that he “bet 1500 total” but added, “I don’t have a gambling problem.”

Subsequent tweets included him saying, “I know I was wrong But I’m getting 1 year lol” and “If you know me you know my character.”

The NFL’s investigation found no evidence that any game was compromised in any way by Ridley’s actions.

Ridley won two national championships during his time at the University of Alabama and was a first-round draft pick for the Falcons in 2018. He had 248 receptions and 28 touchdowns in 49 games in Atlanta, according to NFL.com. In 2020, he was a second team All-Pro selection.

The Falcons traded Ridley in November 2022 to the Jaguars in exchange for draft picks."," Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been reinstated after he was suspended indefinitely after gambling on NFL games during the 2021 season as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, the league said Monday.“Ridley, who had been suspended indefinitely since March 2022 for violating the NFL’s gambling policy, is eligible to participate in all team activities, effective immediately,” officials said.Ridley, 28, said the suspension was self-inflicted and “an isolated lapse in judgment.”“I have always owned my mistakes and this is no different,” Ridley said in a statement. “I have great respect for the game and am excited for the opportunity to restart my career in Jacksonville.

Even before they could climb into the ring, Cuba’s female boxers had to roll with the punches.

While the island has long been famed for its top-level male boxers, women were blocked by an official prohibition on their practicing the sport competitively.

Cuba’s government-run INDER sports institute claimed the sport was too violent for women, even as Cuban female athletes competed successfully in judo, karate and taekwondo.

For many hopeful women boxers on the island, the ban smacked of sexism – and a missed opportunity.

“From the time we were in our mother’s wombs we are fighters,” long-time boxer and trainer Namibia Flores Rodríguez told CNN.

“We are always fighting for something, to raise our kids, to help our families, to be independent.”

Flores says she trained for years as many women interested in boxing do in Cuba: on her own dime and in gyms lacking in even the most basic equipment.

While they could learn and practice the sport as a hobby, the ban on women’s boxing meant Cuban female athletes could not take part in tournaments on the island or abroad.

At least officially, women’s boxing in Cuba did not exist.

A new dawn

In December, the first cracks in that glass ceiling appeared when officials made an about face after announcing that they had obtained the proper safety equipment for them – such as padding and head gear.

“We took this step when we were sure, really convinced that it was the moment and we didn’t have any concerns because our women would be protected,” Cuban Boxing Commission President Alberto Puig de la Barca told reporters at a news conference.

The change, sports officials said at the news conference, was also the result of a newly implemented family code on the island that said women were required by law to have the same opportunities as men. That apparently included boxing.

Two weeks later, the first try outs were held at a cramped facility with a single boxing ring. Many of the women boxers had only recently switched from competing in martial arts or had merely dabbled in boxing.

Still, they sparred with passion, drawing appreciative cheering and applause from spectators.

After the first bout, an announcer exclaimed to the crowd of people watching, “This is historic!”

Boxer Legnis Cala Massó said she started boxing to learn self-defense and was still shocked to be putting on gloves to potentially represent her country.

“My first dream was to participate and that they would consider the women who were fighting in Cuba,” she told CNN ahead of her bout. “Now I want to be on the team.”

While Cuba’s female boxers have a long way to go, officials are hopeful that their enthusiasm and natural ability can make up for lost time. Sports officials predicted that Cuban women boxers would compete in the Central American and Caribbean Games starting in June and the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

Many female boxers said they had endured sexist jabs directed at them over the years, but novice fighter Melany de la Caridad Girado Bermudez told CNN she felt the perception of women taking part in the revered national sport was finally changing.

“In my case all the comments I have received have been positive. That if I make an effort, I can achieve it,” she said. “That Cuban women have the potential for this.”"," Even before they could climb into the ring, Cuba’s female boxers had to roll with the punches.While the island has long been famed for its top-level male boxers, women were blocked by an official prohibition on their practicing the sport competitively.Cuba’s government-run INDER sports institute claimed the sport was too violent for women, even as Cuban female athletes competed successfully in judo, karate and taekwondo.For many hopeful women boxers on the island, the ban smacked of sexism – and a missed opportunity.“From the time we were in our mother’s wombs we are fighters,” long-time boxer and trainer Namibia Flores Rodríguez told .“We are always fighting for something, to raise our kids, to help our families, to be independent.”Cuban women were previously limited to training in isolation and with no hope of competing in the sport.

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

The ""Taste of the Masters"" bundle is back for 2023. The Masters

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."," Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket.

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night."," Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art.

For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.

Or at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.

The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.



It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it’s a ratio he is more than content with.

“Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It’s the pinnacle of our sport, it’s what you’re judged by,” Koepka told CNN.

“If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can’t tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person’s won or that person’s won, but they know exactly how many majors you’ve won.

“So, to me, that’s what you’re defined by.”

‘I love it when athletes get cocky’

They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.

Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It’s a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.

“I’m pretty blunt, I don’t like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I’ve always been that way,” he said. “I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that’s how I feel.

“I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves – I think that’s important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you’re doing.

“If you feel you’re the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.”

And Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.

Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.

Koepka’s current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 – albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.

Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had “dislocated and shattered” his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.

His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix’s new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series “Full Swing,” where Koepka admitted his slump was “the worst” he had ever suffered in his life.

“There was a lot of stuff … just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,” Koepka told CNN.

“The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you’re just sitting there. There’s a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you’ve just got to endure, just to make it better. It’s not always fun, not always glamorous.”

Health is wealth

Yet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.

Alongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner’s earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.

“To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable … something I can really, really look back on,” Koepka said.

“I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year – I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.

“Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that’s the goal.”

Naturally though, that isn’t Koepka’s only goal for 2023. A self-confessed “slow starter,” he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.

Runner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a “good” 2023.

“Hopefully a few wins, and then a major – that’s the goal every year,” he said."," For Brooks Koepka, picking his favorite major win is akin to choosing a favorite child.Or at least, what he imagines the feeling is like.

Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players’ every need is taken care of. If so, think again.

In a survey published by the NFL Players’ Association (NFLPA) on Wednesday, 1,300 players provided feedback on the league’s 32 teams, which were then ranked in a variety of categories.

Look away now if you’re a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Washington Commanders.

NFL players rated teams in the NFLPA’s “Club Report Cards” survey based on their treatment of families, nutrition, weight room, strength and conditioning staff, training room, training staff and locker room. They also provided feedback specific to each team.

The Minnesota Vikings were ranked as the best overall: the NFLPA report pointing to the franchise’s newly built, state-of-the-art facility, calling the team a “shining example of what is possible when a concerted investment is made in both staffing and facilities.”

The Miami Dolphins came second, with the only critique being that players would “like a better post-game family area with more accessibility for players’ families.” The Las Vegas Raiders finished third.

At the other end of the scale, the Chargers, Cardinals and Commanders comprised the bottom three.

The Commanders finished last, with the franchise handed an F-minus for their training room, locker room and team travel, while also getting an F for treatment of families.

Complaints from players included an understaffed training room, undersized hot and cold tubs for player recovery, not enough personal space in the locker room and lack of warm water and issues with poor drainage in the showers.

The Chargers and Cardinals didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Commanders said: “Player health and safety is our top priority, and we continue to invest in our facilities, including a new practice field, new turf in the practice bubble and increased meeting room space. We know there is more to do, and we regularly talk with our players about ways to improve their work environment and the experience for their families.”

Over one-fifth of players surveyed – 22% – also felt they didn’t have enough space on team flights, with the Commanders one of seven teams in the NFL that apparently don’t offer their players first-class seats.

The Cardinals ranked last in terms of food, with players complaining that they were charged for food at the facility, reportedly the only team to do so.

The team was also criticized heavily for the low standard of its facilities, with some complaining the weight room feels like a “safety hazard.”

Players labeled the Chargers’ hot and cold tubs “gross.”

Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars appear to have a bit of a rodent problem.

“When asked what the number one thing they want changed at their facility, the answer was unanimous – get rid of the rats! Players reported that for 3-4 weeks this season, there was a rat infestation in the locker room and laundry hampers,” the report said.

The Jaguars didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of three teams that do not provide dinner to their players and are the only team that doesn’t provide supplements. They are also the only team that does not have outlets in their lockers to charge devices.

The rankings aren’t necessarily an indication of success on the field though, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs coming in at 29th.

The objective of the “Club Report Cards” was to help provide “players with information about each club to not only help them make important career decisions, but also try and raise standards across each club,” according to NFLPA president JC Tretter.

“One of our core jobs as a union is to improve the overall working conditions for our players,” added Tretter.

“Often, you see our advocacy on ‘big’ issues – like our push for better field surfaces at stadiums or standardized safety protocols that limit the risk of workplace injuries – but it also includes the daily experience of players at the team facilities away from the lights and cameras,” he said."," Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players’ every need is taken care of.

Paris Saint-Germain will be without star forward Neymar for the remainder of the season after it was announced the Brazilian will have to undergo surgery on his ankle injury.

Neymar was stretchered off on February 19 during PSG’s 4-3 victory over Lille after rolling his right ankle, the same injury that forced him to miss some of Brazil’s World Cup campaign.

“Neymar Jr has sustained a number of instances of instability in his right ankle in recent years,” PSG said in a statement.

“The Paris Saint-Germain medical staff recommended a ligament repair operation to avoid a major risk of recurrence. All the experts consulted have confirmed this necessity.”

PSG says it will be three to four months of recovery before Neymar can rejoin team training.

The 31-year-old has suffered a number of right ankle or foot injuries in the past, which forced him to miss six weeks of action in 2021 and Brazil’s victorious 2019 Copa América campaign.

PSG faces an uphill task to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Wednesday when it travels to Bayern Munich to try and overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit.

The team has already been knocked out of the French Cup, but has opened up an eight-point lead over Marseille at the top of Ligue 1 as it bids to win an 11th French title.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"," Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells  Sports.Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016. Apple TV+Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association. Apple TV+The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."," Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf.

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"," Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.Putellas collects the award for the Best FIFA Women's Player.

Time might have run out for Novak Djokovic to be admitted US entry to play at Indian Wells, but US politicians – notably Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – are lobbying for regulations to change and allow the world No. 1 into the country in time for the Miami Open.

The US still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously said he remains unvaccinated, confirmed he had applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments.

However, Indian Wells organizers announced on Sunday that Djokovic had withdrawn from the tournament, where main draw play began Wednesday.

DeSantis said he would “run a boat from the Bahamas” for Djokovic to compete in the Miami Open tennis tournament later this month.

“I would run a boat from the Bahamas here for him. I would do that a hundred percent,” DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa Wednesday.

“I think his people are looking at it, and I’m not sure that’s the way they want to come into the country, which I understand. I think it’d be a great moment, but you know, nevertheless.”

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director, proof of Covid-19 vaccination is required for non-U.S. citizens, non-immigrant passengers arriving from a foreign country to the US by air, though that applies to other forms of travel.

On Tuesday, DeSantis had called on US President Joe Biden to intervene and allow Djokovic to compete in the tournament.

“The only thing keeping Novak Djokovic from participating in the Miami Open tennis tournament is President Biden’s misguided and unscientific COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreigner travelers,” DeSantis, who has separately vowed to permanently ban mandates related to coronavirus mitigation as he considers a presidential bid, said on Twitter.

“Mr. President – lift your restrictions and let him compete,” he added.

Republican Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida also urged the US president to allow Djokovic into the country to play.

“On a question of regarding the vaccination requirement, I refer you to the CDC – are the ones who deal with that,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday.

The vaccine requirement, she said, “is still in place, and we expect everyone to abide by our country’s rule, whether as a participant or spectator.”

US Open organizers said on Friday that they and the United States Tennis Association were “hopeful” that Djokovic was successful in his petition.

“Novak Djokovic is one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a six-time champion of the Miami Open,” the Miami Open said on Twitter on Friday.

“We hope he is allowed entry into the country so Floridians have the opportunity to see him compete once again.”

CNN has reached out to representatives for Djokovic and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” the 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade last month.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Djokovic returned to the world No. 1 position when he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to win a record 10th Australian Open in January.

It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

13,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/08/sport/ja-morant-memphis-grizzzlies-gun-lakers-loss-spt-intl,"CNN —

Facing three injuries, the Memphis Grizzlies have taken another player off their court. But this time, it’s due to police and NBA investigations into the team’s star player.

The Grizzlies lost their second straight game Tuesday without star guard Ja Morant, who is under investigation after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of Denver.

Morant has apologized for his actions via his representation on Saturday, after Memphis announced he would be away from the team.

Morant said he would take time away “to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.”

Memphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said Sunday there is no timetable for Morant’s return. The team tweeted Wednesday that Morant will miss at least four more games, meaning he will return no earlier than March 17.

Morant is averaging 27.1 points per game in his fourth NBA season.

The Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows Morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.

The police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said Wednesday the agency won’t recommend charges against Morant.

“(The department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. In this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any type,” department officials said in a statement.

No one made a complaint and investigators concluded no one was threatened or menaced with a gun, police said.

The league is also investigating the two-time All-Star point guard and the video, an NBA spokesperson told CNN.

It’s unknown why Morant was carrying a gun or if it was his. The Grizzlies played in Houston against the Rockets on March 1 before heading to Denver for a game against the Nuggets on March 3.

If Morant did bring the gun onto team facilities – which also includes the team plane – he is subject to NBA discipline according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

The CBA states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while “physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player’s Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity”

If a player is in violation of the ruling in the CBA, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.

“The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the Association,” the CBA reads.

While it is unclear what punishment Morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when Gilbert Arenas, a three-time All-Star, was suspended until the end of the season – 50 games – for bringing unloaded guns into his team’s locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.

Arenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate Javaris Crittenton – who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident – over money in a poker game.

The US government said at the time that Arenas brought at least one firearm into the Washington Wizards’ locker room.

Arenas would later return to the Wizards, while Crittenton was released by Washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in August 2011. In April 2015, Crittenton plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 23 years in prison.

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies are not having a great time of it on the court. Their 112-103 defeat by the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena in LA on Tuesday came two days after losing in the same building to the Los Angeles Clippers.

Jaren Jackson Jr. led the way for the Grizzlies, finishing with 26 points, but it wasn’t enough as a dominant Anthony Davis – who racked up 30 points and 22 rebounds – and 17 points each for Dennis Schröder, Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves led the surging Lakers to a seventh win in 10 games as they attempt to make the playoffs.

Still, the Grizzlies sit third in the Western Conference with a 38-26 record."," Facing three injuries, the Memphis Grizzlies have taken another player off their court. But this time, it’s due to police and NBA investigations into the team’s star player.The Grizzlies lost their second straight game Tuesday without star guard Ja Morant, who is under investigation after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of Denver.Morant has apologized for his actions via his representation on Saturday, after Memphis announced he would be away from the team.Morant said he would take time away “to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.”Memphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said Sunday there is no timetable for Morant’s return. The team tweeted Wednesday that Morant will miss at least four more games, meaning he will return no earlier than March 17.Morant is averaging 27.1 points per game in his fourth NBA season.The Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows Morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.The police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said Wednesday the agency won’t recommend charges against Morant.“(The department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. In this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any type,” department officials said in a statement.No one made a complaint and investigators concluded no one was threatened or menaced with a gun, police said.The league is also investigating the two-time All-Star point guard and the video, an NBA spokesperson told .Video Ad Feedback 'Most exciting young star' away from NBA court after gun controversy 02:04 - Source: It’s unknown why Morant was carrying a gun or if it was his. The Grizzlies played in Houston against the Rockets on March 1 before heading to Denver for a game against the Nuggets on March 3.If Morant did bring the gun onto team facilities – which also includes the team plane – he is subject to NBA discipline according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).The CBA states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while “physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player’s Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity”If a player is in violation of the ruling in the CBA, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.“The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the Association,” the CBA reads.While it is unclear what punishment Morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when Gilbert Arenas, a three-time All-Star, was suspended until the end of the season – 50 games – for bringing unloaded guns into his team’s locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.Arenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate Javaris Crittenton – who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident – over money in a poker game.The US government said at the time that Arenas brought at least one firearm into the Washington Wizards’ locker room.Arenas would later return to the Wizards, while Crittenton was released by Washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in August 2011.

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"," It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

UEFA plans to refund all Liverpool supporters who had tickets for the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris, the governing body of European soccer announced on Tuesday.

Last year’s final was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.

There was widespread criticism about the way fans were treated at the game, with UK Member of Parliament Ian Byrne – who was at the match as a Liverpool fan – describing the situation outside the stadium as “one of the most horrendous experiences of my life.”

A UEFA statement on the refund said: “UEFA will implement a special refund scheme for fans who were most affected when accessing the Stade de France on 28 May 2022.

“Refunds will be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z where the most difficult circumstances were reported.

“Given these criteria, the special refund scheme covers all of the Liverpool FC ticket allocation for the Final, i.e. 19,618 tickets.”

UEFA noted that Real Madrid fans and neutral supporters affected while accessing the stadium can also claim refunds, depending on whether they meet the criteria.

An independent review commissioned by UEFA found that the organization bears “primary responsibility” for circumstances which almost caused the event to turn into a “mass fatality catastrophe.”

“We recognize the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and, with this scheme, we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium,” UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said.

“We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair.

“We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organizations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period,” Theodoridis added.

Spirit of Shankly (SOS) issued a statement in conjunction with the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Society, reading: “We welcome today’s announcement from UEFA. This unprecedented move is the result of tireless work, alongside FSE (Football Supporters Europe) and Ian Byrne MP, to hold those responsible for the catastrophic events in Paris.

“With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledging their part in the fiasco. But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.

“We will work alongside Liverpool and publish details once we know how and when refunds will be processed.”

In a statement on Tuesday, Tony Winterburn – a partner at Pogust Goodhead, the law firm running the case against UEFA on behalf of Liverpool fans who attended the Champions League final – said the refund scheme is insufficient compensation.

“Digesting the fine details of this scheme will allow us to determine if it is, in fact, ‘comprehensive and fair’. Although this does present as a step towards UEFA accepting responsibility for the events, our legal case is still progressing,” Winterburn said.

“It is pertinent the extent of the physical and psychological injuries of our clients remains at the forefront of this process.

“We believe the term ‘refund,’ in its broadest sense, does not go far enough in providing redress or acknowledging the true harm suffered by those at an event that should have been safe for all to attend.”"," UEFA plans to refund all Liverpool supporters who had tickets for the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris, the governing body of European soccer announced on Tuesday.Last year’s final was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.There was widespread criticism about the way fans were treated at the game, with UK Member of Parliament Ian Byrne – who was at the match as a Liverpool fan – describing the situation outside the stadium as “one of the most horrendous experiences of my life.”A UEFA statement on the refund said: “UEFA will implement a special refund scheme for fans who were most affected when accessing the Stade de France on 28 May 2022.“Refunds will be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z where the most difficult circumstances were reported.“Given these criteria, the special refund scheme covers all of the Liverpool FC ticket allocation for the Final, i.e. 19,618 tickets.”UEFA noted that Real Madrid fans and neutral supporters affected while accessing the stadium can also claim refunds, depending on whether they meet the criteria.Police patrol inside the Stade de France during the 2022 Champions League Final.

This unprecedented move is the result of tireless work, alongside FSE (Football Supporters Europe) and Ian Byrne MP, to hold those responsible for the catastrophic events in Paris.“With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledging their part in the fiasco. But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.“We will work alongside Liverpool and publish details once we know how and when refunds will be processed.”In a statement on Tuesday, Tony Winterburn – a partner at Pogust Goodhead, the law firm running the case against UEFA on behalf of Liverpool fans who attended the Champions League final – said the refund scheme is insufficient compensation.“Digesting the fine details of this scheme will allow us to determine if it is, in fact, ‘comprehensive and fair’. Although this does present as a step towards UEFA accepting responsibility for the events, our legal case is still progressing,” Winterburn said.“It is pertinent the extent of the physical and psychological injuries of our clients remains at the forefront of this process.“We believe the term ‘refund,’ in its broadest sense, does not go far enough in providing redress or acknowledging the true harm suffered by those at an event that should have been safe for all to attend.”",,"Paris, European, France, French, B, X, Shankly, Liverpool","Dylan, Spirit, Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association, Ian Byrne MP, Liverpool, Tony Winterburn, Winterburn","UEFA, Liverpool, UK, Parliament Ian Byrne, Real Madrid, SOS, LDSA, Liverpool Disabled Supporters Society, FSE, Football Supporters Europe, Pogust Goodhead, Champions League","UEFA,Parliament,Liverpool,FC,Real,Madrid,General,Shankly,(,SOS,),Disabled,Supporters,Association,the,Society,FSE,Football,Europe,Pogust,Goodhead,Champions,League,Winterburn","Liverpool, Paris, UK","Ian, Byrne, Dylan, Martinez, Theodore, Theodoridis, MP, Tony, Winterburn",

Minnesota Vikings’ star KJ Osborn says he and three other people helped save a man who was trapped inside a burning car in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.

“Most of the time the saying goes ‘wrong place wrong time.’ But this time I believe God had me, us, at the right place at the exact right time,” third-year wide receiver Osborn said in a Twitter post on Monday.

“Last night myself and these 3 absolute hero’s helped save a man’s life by rescuing him from a vehicle up in flames after a bad crash. A situation I’d never imagine being apart of in a million years.

“I’ll leave you with this. God is real. And His LOVE is real. He will send his angels to be camped around you and provide you with his grace and mercy.”

Osborn posted several photos of the disturbing scene. One showed a burning car with what appears to be a man aiding a person inside.

Another is a photo of the aftermath of the wrecked and scorched vehicle. And a third of himself, and the three other people who he says helped the man escape the burning wreck.

CNN has reached out to the Austin police department but did not immediately hear back.

Osborn spoke about the incident on ESPN’s Adam Schefter’s podcast, saying: “I’m on my way home, I’m on the back of an Uber, and my head is down and I’m on my phone, just on my way home.

“My Uber driver just starts going crazy. He’s like, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I look up, and I’m wondering what’s all the fuss about and there’s nobody on the street.

“He’s like, ‘This guy crashed,’ and I look to my right and there’s a car, if you were to picture it, under a bridge’s pillars. His car is head-on. He hit the pillar and his car is in flames.”

The 25-year-old, who was chosen in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft out of the University of Miami, said his Uber driver exited the car and insisted they call 911.

The driver then ran up to the car door, and Osborn followed. After initial hesitation, Osborn said he and the driver, with the help of two others on the scene, then pulled the man out the vehicle, picked him up and carried him to safety then waited with him until emergency medical services, firefighters and the police arrived.

Osborn, who is training in Austin, says he has been in contact with the man and intends to visit him at the hospital, together with the three others who helped save him. He added that he believes the man only suffered minor injuries.

“I’m just grateful that I was in the position to be able to help him as well as the three other heroes to be there.”

18,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"CNN —

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."," The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told  Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022. Alaa Badarneh/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockGeneral Secretary of the PFA Hilal told  Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”Coach Daboub goes even further.“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said.","West Bank,Gaza City,East Jerusalem,Gaza Strip,Gaza,West,West Asian","Palestinian, Palestine, Portugal, African, Middle East, Israel, Palestinians, Palestianian, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, United, Arabic, Israeli, Tubas, Nablus, Hamas, Jerusalem, Japan, United States, Singapore, Canaan, Tunisian, Egyptian, Entry, Asian, Egypt, Qatar, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Spanish, Ramallah, Portuguese, North Korea, Jiangyin, China, Gao, European, Arouca, Belgian, Bethlehem, Tel Aviv, Asia","Arab, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Nakba, Arab Emirates, Ulrik, Rami Hamadeh, Ahmed Daraghmeh, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud Sarsak, Mahmud, Sarsak, Mongolia, Jabal, Bnei, Jibril Rajoub, Henley, Suhaib, Makram Daboub, Daboub, Arab Cup, Gianni Infantino, Ismail El Haddad, Yaser Hamed, Hamed, Spain, Thomas Bach, Issam, Rajoub, Firas Abu Hilal, Shaheen, Shaheen., Sports, Dabbagh, Song Kum Song, Jiangsu, Portugal, Alaa, Hilal., Abu, Morocco","Qatar, Atlas Lions, Hamadeh, Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, AFC Asian, IDF, Reuters, Islamic Jihad, Philippines, IDs, PFA, AP, Partners, FIFA, AFC, WAFF, FA Jibril, IOC, General, National, projectsThe, IFA, Futsal Hall, Faisal, Palestine, PFA Hilal, UEFA","the,Atlas,Lions,AFC,Asian,Cup,Tubas,Israel,Defense,Forces,IDF,Reuters,Hamas,Al,-,Shifa,Islamic,Jihad,Palestinian,Football,Association,AP,Henley,&,Partners,FIFA,Suhaib,Salem,ReutersThe,Visa,The,Confederation,West,Federation,WAFF,IOC,Issam,Rimawi,/,Anadolu,Agency,Getty,ImagesThe,PFA,National,Olympic,Committee,“To,Oday,Dabbagh,F.C.,Arouca,R.,Charleroi,S.C,’s,IFA,FIFA.They,Palestine,Ram,Hilal,football,association,UEFA,World,Cup,”Coach,Daboub","Qatar, Portugal, Israel, the, West, Bank, Gaza, East, Jerusalem, Abu, Dhabi, United, Arab, Emirates, Nablus, City, Philippines, Mongolia, Yemen, Strip, London, Japan, States, forfeit, Singapore, Daboub, The, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi, Arabia, Spain, Palestine, Ramallah, North, Korea, Jiangyin, city, China, Jiangsu, Bethlehem, Tel, Aviv, boycotts, Asian, Cups","Rami, Hamadeh, Jordan, Ulrik, Pedersen, /, CSM, Zuma, Sports, Ahmed, Daraghmeh, Mahmoud, Sarsak, Mahmud, Hams, AFP, Getty, ImagesPalestinian, Jabal, Al, -, Mukaber, Bnei, Sakhnin, Gazan, Makram, Daboub, Gianni, Infantino, Ismail, El, Haddad, Yaser, Hamed, Thomas, Bach, Firas, Abu, Hilal, Diala, Shaheen, Song, Kum, Gao, meng, Imaginechina, APDabbagh, Faisal, Husseini, Stadium, Jibril, Rajoub, Alaa, Badarneh","the, Middle, East, Asia"

More than a year after US Soccer and the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) brokered a landmark equal pay agreement, USWNT star player and two-time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe is still coming to terms with the implications of what her team has achieved.

Following years of lawsuits and lobbying from players, the Federation last year agreed to a new 50-50 split in the way it pays men and women competing for the US national soccer teams, meaning both sides will receive the same pay and prize money, including for participating at World Cups.

“There was a relentlessness, and a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved,” Rapinoe told WBD sports analyst Julie Foudy, adding she’s proud of “the group effort that it took.”

“It was almost like we couldn’t lose, I said that a lot. If the Federation won, everybody loses and if we win, everybody wins,” the two-time World Cup champion added.

Rapinoe said the team worked together and saw setbacks, not as losses, but as “just a step on the journey. Ultimately, I think that gave us a lot of confidence on the field as well – we were all in it together, we were all doing our part.”

“There’s something about feeling desperate that is really powerful, and I think, at times, we were,” she added, saying the team felt an immense pressure to win the Women’s World Cup in 2019 while battling to prove their worth off the field – they did, defending their 2015 title, beating The Netherlands in the final thanks to goals from Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle.

“We obviously want[ed] to win, professionally, as your sport, but there was some understanding of desperation there. We have this opportunity to grasp this moment, and I think [with] the combination of personalities, we knew that and we rose to that occasion,” she said.

The agreement has already changed the way remuneration works in US Soccer: the USWNT earned more money from its male equivalent reaching the knockout stages of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar than it did from winning its own tournaments in 2015 and 2019.

It also means the USMNT will pick up half of the USWNT’s prize money in the future.

Ripple effect

Rapinoe reflected that when fighting for equal pay, the women’s team had a unique opportunity to make change as a collective, which in turn inspired women around the world who were having to push for changes on their own.

“What we’re most proud of is that it’s been something that people can see themselves in and gain confidence from,” she said.

“We’re in a really unique and special situation to be around a bunch of other elite women: that almost never happens,” she explained.

The agreement, Rapinoe reflected, came as part of ""a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved."" Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images

“If you’re the best at what you do, normally you’re one of one, or one of a few if you’re in a company, or if you’re in a C-suite position, most likely, you’re one of one or one of two. It’s not very often that you have 20-something women that are able to do that, so I think that women put themselves in there with us.”

Rapinoe said she has heard stories of women who asked for a raise based on the team’s success.

“It’s almost like they’re… getting that imagery of all of us standing behind them and having that confidence.

“We kind of realized early on that this was such a bigger movement that we were a part of. Yes, we’re one of the sort of ‘out front’ main players, even just in the soccer world or in the women’s sports world in general, we were a part of something so much bigger.

“I think other women who don’t necessarily have the ability to have a bunch of other women around them saw themselves in us and were able to use that as motivation and be on our team,” she said."," More than a year after US Soccer and the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) brokered a landmark equal pay agreement, USWNT star player and two-time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe is still coming to terms with the implications of what her team has achieved.Following years of lawsuits and lobbying from players, the Federation last year agreed to a new 50-50 split in the way it pays men and women competing for the US national soccer teams, meaning both sides will receive the same pay and prize money, including for participating at World Cups.“There was a relentlessness, and a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved,” Rapinoe told WBD sports analyst Julie Foudy, adding she’s proud of “the group effort that it took.”“It was almost like we couldn’t lose, I said that a lot.

Since the ownership group led by American businessman Todd Boehly spent more than than $5 billion on buying Chelsea last year, they’ve seen very little return on their investment.

Over $600 million has been spent on new players, but the club finds itself floundering 10th in the Premier League and struggling for form.

There have subsequently been questions raised about manager Graham Potter’s future at the club, but the side’s 2-1 aggregate win against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday could be the turning point that everyone at Chelsea needs.

Potter, who looked like the most relieved man at Stamford Bridge after his side overturned a 1-0 defeat from the first leg, was seen hugging a jubilant Boehly as the teams made their way back to the dressing rooms.

“I’m still here,” Potter joked with reporters when asked about the brief meeting.

Goals from Raheem Sterling and Kai Havertz secured the win that sends Chelsea through to the quarterfinals of Europe’s most prestigious club competition.

It also marks an upturn in form after Chelsea went through the whole month of February without a win. During the bleak period of results, Potter opened up about the mental toll its taken on him and his family.

“Inevitably in life, you are going to have bad times and you’re going to have good times. Things are never bad forever, thankfully. But it felt like that sometimes,” he added after Tuesday’s match.

The victory wasn’t without controversy though, with Chelsea’s second coming from a retaken penalty after Havertz saw his first attempt saved by Alexander Meyer.

The referee had spotted players encroaching into the box before the first effort, so the Chelsea striker was given a second chance to put his side ahead.

“I was a bit nervous,” he told reporters, talking about the penalty incident. “But I scored, and that’s the most important thing.

“I tried to wait, to look at the goalkeeper, and I saw that he was going to go to the same side again.”

Jude Bellingham angry

The decision to allow Chelsea to have another chance at the penalty angered Dortmund’s young midfielder Jude Bellingham who was disappointed the spot-kick was awarded in the first place after the ball struck defender Marius Wolf’s hand.

“I’m not sure what more he can do with his hand,” Bellingham told BT Sport, referring to Wolf. “That in itself was disappointing and the fact that they’ve had a retake, I think it’s a joke.

“For every penalty, especially when you have such a slow run up, there’s going to be people encroaching into the box by a yard or so. He has made the decision and we have to live with it.”

Bellingham, who has been outspoken about refereeing decisions in the past, was trying to be careful with what he said.

“I’ve paid enough to them lot,” he added, referring to fines he’s received for post-match comments in the past.

Chelsea fans celebrated the full-time whistle with huge celebrations and will hope their side can now kick on and improve on its lowly position in the league table.

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."," It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour.

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from this week’s BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, the tournament announced on Sunday, suggesting that his visa application to enter the United States had been unsuccessful.

Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, said last month that he had hoped for a “positive result” on being able to receive special permission to play tournaments in the US, where international visitors must be vaccinated in order to gain entry.

Georgian player Nikoloz Basilashvili has taken Djokovic’s place in the draw.

Speaking to reporters on Friday after his defeat against Daniil Medvedev in Dubai, the Australian Open champion said he was “still waiting for the news from America.”

He added: “If there’s no America, I guess I’ll play clay. Monte Carlo is probably the next tournament. If that’s the case, I’ll take some time off, I’ll prepare.”

CNN has contacted Djokovic’s representatives for comment on his withdrawal from Indian Wells but did not receive a response.

The tournament begins on Monday and concludes on March 19.

Last week, the US Open said in a tweet that Djokovic is one of the “greatest champions our sport has ever seen,” adding that organizers of the grand slam were “hopeful” his petition to enter the country would be successful.

Djokovic began the year by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas to win the Australian Open, equaling Rafael Nadal’s record of 22 grand slam singles titles in the men’s all-time list.

He could surpass Nadal’s record at the French Open later this year, though the Spaniard will be looking to defend his title as he continues his recovery from injury."," World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from this week’s BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, the tournament announced on Sunday, suggesting that his visa application to enter the United States had been unsuccessful.Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, said last month that he had hoped for a “positive result” on being able to receive special permission to play tournaments in the US, where international visitors must be vaccinated in order to gain entry.Georgian player Nikoloz Basilashvili has taken Djokovic’s place in the draw.Speaking to reporters on Friday after his defeat against Daniil Medvedev in Dubai, the Australian Open champion said he was “still waiting for the news from America.”He added: “If there’s no America, I guess I’ll play clay.

It was a long week and an even longer year, but Ko Jin-young is a champion once again.

Almost a year to the day since her record-shattering victory at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, the South Korean returned to Singapore to defend her crown and seal her 14th LPGA Tour victory.

After a week delayed at various points by heavy rain, Ko carded 17-under to finish two shots ahead of American Nelly Korda and become the first player in the tournament’s 15-year history to secure back-to-back wins.

It marked a cathartic return to the winner’s circle for Ko, who has struggled with a persistent wrist injury since the second half of 2022. Tears flowed almost as soon as she tapped home her closing putt for par, as the 27-year-old shared an emotional hug with caddie David Brooker.

“It’s a great honor to defend this title again. This week was too long for me but too great, so I’m so happy,” Ko told reporters.

When Ko left Singapore a year ago, she did so at the peak of her powers. The then-world No. 1 had just sealed her sixth tournament victory in her last ten starts, creating history in the process. A final round 66 marked Ko’s 15th consecutive round in the 60s, breaking Annika Sörenstam’s 16-year-old record of 14.

She returned to Sentosa Golf Club last week under wildly contrasting circumstances. In August 2022, Ko missed cuts at back-to-back events for the first time in her career, subsequently taking a seven-week break from the sport to treat a left wrist injury.

A comeback at the BMW Ladies Championship the following month ended prematurely with a withdrawal, followed up by another missed cut at the Pelican Women’s Championship. When she arrived at the CME Group Tour Championship in November, she did so as the world No. 4.

There, she told reporters that every swing hurt. Four months on, she is a champion again, toasting the “most important” win of her career.

“Because I had a tough year last year, and I fought with injury and not good game and mentally tough and everything, and then I won this week,” Ko said.

“It’s going to be more important to me and it’s going to be big momentum for me in my life.”

Raining pars

After opening with an even par 72, back-to-back 65s roared Ko into a two-shot lead over Korda heading into the final round.

A run of three straight birdies saw Korda, chasing her ninth LPGA title, cut the gap to one by the sixth hole, but a subsequent bogey – and another at the 13th – saw Ko take a healthy three-stroke cushion into the closing three holes.

An anxious wait ensued for Ko after heavy rain – having postponed action for over two hours Saturday – delayed proceedings for close to an hour, but the South Korean held her nerve to return and sink three consecutive pars to ease home with 71 and clinch the $270,000 winner’s prize.

“I [knew] Nelly [was] behind me. I thought it was just one or two shots, so it was close,” Ko said.

“But after the delay, I rested in dining, and I saw the TV and the scoreboard, and [I had] a three-shot lead. But I had two more holes left so, ‘Okay, let’s make par, play safe.’ But it was really hard to make par on 17, 18.”

Korda’s closing birdie saw her card 69, her fourth successive round in the 60s, but the world No. 2 was left to rue “silly mistakes” that undermined an ultimately strong showing in Singapore.

“Obviously, a little disappointed with today,” Korda told reporters.

“Didn’t play really well but kind of didn’t really battle as much as I wanted to. I just made a couple kind of silly mistakes here and there. It was nice to finish with a birdie and be in contention again, be in the final group feeling the emotions.”"," It was a long week and an even longer year, but Ko Jin-young is a champion once again.Almost a year to the day since her record-shattering victory at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, the South Korean returned to Singapore to defend her crown and seal her 14th LPGA Tour victory.After a week delayed at various points by heavy rain, Ko carded 17-under to finish two shots ahead of American Nelly Korda and become the first player in the tournament’s 15-year history to secure back-to-back wins.It marked a cathartic return to the winner’s circle for Ko, who has struggled with a persistent wrist injury since the second half of 2022.

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk refused to shake hands with her Russian opponent Varvara Gracheva after claiming victory in the final of the ATX Open in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.

Kostyuk defeated Gracheva 6-3 7-5, collapsing to the court after converting match point, before refusing to shake hands with the Russian.

The 20-year-old, who is from Kyiv, said at January’s Australian Open that she would not shake hands with any Russian or Belarusian opponent with war raging in her country.

She refused to shake hands with Victoria Azarenka of Belarus at the US Open in September last year. Belarus is being used as a key staging ground for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Kostyuk dedicated her maiden WTA singles title to her native country during the trophy presentation.

“Being in the position that I am in right now, it’s extremely special to win this title,” Kostyuk said.

“And I want to dedicate this title to Ukraine and to all the people that are fighting and dying right now.”

Kostyuk did not acknowledge the beaten finalist in her acceptance speech.

The tournament win, the first for a Ukrainian woman since Elina Svitolina in 2021, elevated Kostyuk to No. 40 in the WTA rankings.

Among the grand slams, only Wimbledon has banned Russian and Belarusian players from competing, leading to a $1 million fine by the men’s tour.

More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,” the Spaniard said ahead of the season’s start.

“There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.”

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport’s history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso’s fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans’ 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

“The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,” he says of Aston Martin’s “wonderful project.”

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin’s boss and the father of Alonso’s new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso’s terrific performance at pre-season testing – where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain – Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making “political, religious and personal statements” unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to “express their views on any political, religious or personal matter” outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months – a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: “The problem is that we are traveling so much and it’s getting more and more … Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?”

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks “probably not.”

“But this is maybe not our role on this sport,” he added. “We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

“I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.”

While Alonso admits that it will be “challenging,” he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

“I think it’s going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,” he said. “But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.”

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin’s chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a “realistic target at the moment,” but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Boston Red Sox third baseman Justin Turner is resting at home after he was hit in the face by a pitch which required 16 stitches.

Turner was hit by a fastball from Detroit Tigers pitcher Matt Manning in the bottom of the first inning during Monday’s game.

In an ugly scene, the 38-year-old lay on the ground with blood coming from his face before being helped away by members of Boston’s medical team.

After the game, the Red Sox said the two-time All-Star had been taken to a local hospital.

“He is receiving treatment for soft tissue injuries and is being monitored for a concussion,” the statement said. “He will undergo further testing, and we’ll update as we have more information. Justin is stable, alert and in good spirits given the circumstances.”

Turner later reposted an Instagram story from his wife which gave an update on his condition.

“Thank you to everyone that reached out about Justin and sent prayers,” Kourtney Turner wrote. “We’re home now and he’s resting (okay – maybe listening to the replay of the game).

“16 stitches and a lot of swelling but we are thanking God for no fractures and clear scans!”

Manning told reporters that he plans to reach out and apologize to Turner, stressing the pitch was not intentional.

“It was a complete accident; ball just got away,” Manning said. “I got a swing and miss on a ball kind of up in the zone, so I tried to go back to it, and it just got away from me.”

The Red Sox went on to beat the Tigers 7-1.

Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.

If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.

“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we’re going to have more of that.”

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as “trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.”

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour’s membership, the new schedule will include eight “designated events” made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as “designated,” are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the “framework” for eligibility will “reward top performers” on the Tour – including the top 50 players from the previous year’s FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and “prestige” of the tournaments, will “incentivize” participation, the Tour added.

“These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can’t-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,” Monahan said in the letter to players.

“Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.”

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

‘Imitation is the greatest form of flattery’

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season’s calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour’s inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

“Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,” read a tweet from LIV Golf’s official account Wednesday.

Ahead of the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule’s restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers “on the outside looking in,” the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

“I love it,” McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously I’ve been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

“I’m all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There’s ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a “closed shop,” the world No. 2 said: “I think it’s exciting because you’re going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

“You’re going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that’s a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

“I think it’s a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

“If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of ‘em … I think it’s more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.”

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a “motivating factor” for players on the PGA Tour.

“We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don’t think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,” Scheffler said.

“You can’t really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you’re out here playing golf tournaments you’re never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

“So as being kind of a golf purist, that’s the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.”

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events – including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship – as proof there is a “precedent” for the format.

“The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along … There’s been no-cut events since I’ve been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,” McIlroy said.

“It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that’s what needs to happen, then that’s what happens.”

Homa’s ‘rant’

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could “rant on this for awhile” regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood “gripes” around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

“I think it’s easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players’ pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,” said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a “running joke” due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

“Those people will be in a ton of the events,” he said.

“Now the sponsors have to say, ‘Well do we want … a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,” added Homa.

“It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

“So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it’s important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don’t, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

“It will be a different kind of stress that we haven’t had before, but I do think it will be stressful.”

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: “Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.”"," Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn’t go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.If the PGA Tour’s revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf’s major stars against one another more regularly, the sport’s latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series.“It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,” world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.“Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles.

A supporter of English football club Blackpool has died after an altercation took place between fans on Saturday.

According to Lancashire Police, Tony Johnson, 55, suffered a serious head injury when a fight broke out between Blackpool and Burnley fans. The fight occurred outside a pub in Blackpool at around 7 p.m. local time.

Officers administered CPR to Johnson at the scene, police said, before he was taken to hospital.

“Sadly Mr Johnson died in hospital overnight and his family are, understandably, devastated,” Detective Chief Inspector Tracey McMurdo of Lancashire Police said in a statement on Monday.

“We are supporting them at this difficult time and are determined to get them answers about what happened. The investigation continues and we will pursue anybody involved to bring them to justice.”

A 33-year-old man from Burnley was arrested at the scene on suspicion of wounding and he has since been bailed until June 1, according to the Lancashire Police statement.

Police have also appealed for anyone with footage of the incident to come forward and refrain from posting it on social media.

In a statement on Monday, Blackpool said the club is “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the news that supporter, Tony Johnson, tragically lost his life earlier this morning,” adding that “all of the thoughts of everyone at the football club go out to Tony’s family and friends.”

The club is also inviting fans to honor Johnson, a lifelong Blackpool fan, by laying flowers at its stadium, Bloomfield Road, on Monday.

Blackpool and Burnley both play in the Championship, English football’s second tier. After the teams’ 0-0 draw on Saturday, Burnley is 13 points clear at the top of the table, while Blackpool remains in the relegation zone."," A supporter of English football club Blackpool has died after an altercation took place between fans on Saturday.According to Lancashire Police, Tony Johnson, 55, suffered a serious head injury when a fight broke out between Blackpool and Burnley fans.
